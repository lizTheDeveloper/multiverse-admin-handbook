# Marshall Rosenberg: Nonviolent Communication as Liberatory Practice

## Who Was Marshall Rosenberg?

Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D. (1934-2015) was an American psychologist who developed Nonviolent Communication (NVC), a framework for compassionate human connection that has been used in conflict resolution, education, therapy, and peace-building worldwide.

**Key work:**
- *Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life* (1999, 3rd ed. 2015)

Rosenberg studied under Carl Rogers (humanistic psychology) and was influenced by the civil rights movement. He spent decades teaching NVC in war zones, prisons, schools, and communities, demonstrating that connection is possible even in conditions of extreme violence.

## What Is Nonviolent Communication?

NVC is a framework for **compassionate connection** through language that honors our shared humanity.

### The Core Insight

> "NVC helps us connect with each other and ourselves in a way that allows our natural compassion to flourish."

**Rosenberg's premise:**
- Humans are naturally compassionate
- Violence (physical, emotional, linguistic) is learned
- When we connect to universal human needs, compassion emerges
- Language shapes how we relate

### Why "Nonviolent"?

Named after Gandhi's principle of **ahimsa** (nonviolence, non-harming).

**Violent communication:**
- Judgments and evaluations
- Diagnosing and labeling
- Demands and ultimatums
- Blame and shame
- Denying responsibility for our feelings

**Nonviolent communication:**
- Observations without judgment
- Expressing feelings and needs
- Making requests, not demands
- Taking responsibility for our experience
- Connecting to our shared humanity

## The Four Components of NVC

NVC has four steps for expressing ourselves and empathically listening to others.

### 1. Observations (Not Evaluations)

**Observation:** What we see or hear, free of evaluation.
**Evaluation:** Judgment, interpretation, diagnosis.

| ❌ Evaluation | ✅ Observation |
|---|---|
| "You're being manipulative" | "When you ask me for support right after I've said I need rest" |
| "You're lazy" | "When the project deadline passed without submission" |
| "You interrupt all the time" | "When I was speaking for 30 seconds, you started talking" |

**Why observations matter:**
- Evaluations trigger defensiveness
- Observations create openness
- We can agree on observations even if we interpret them differently

### 2. Feelings (Not Thoughts Disguised as Feelings)

**Feeling:** An emotion in your body.
**Thought:** What you think about a situation.

| ❌ Thought | ✅ Feeling |
|---|---|
| "I feel like you don't care" | "I feel hurt" |
| "I feel manipulated" | "I feel anxious and distrustful" |
| "I feel that this is unfair" | "I feel frustrated and disappointed" |

**Why feelings matter:**
- Feelings are data about our needs
- Naming feelings creates connection
- Feelings are universal — we all experience them

**Rosenberg's insight:** When we blame others for our feelings ("you made me angry"), we give away our power. Our feelings come from our needs, not from what others do.

### 3. Needs (Universal Human Needs, Not Strategies)

**Need:** Universal human requirement (safety, understanding, autonomy, etc.)
**Strategy:** A specific way to meet a need.

| ❌ Strategy | ✅ Need |
|---|---|
| "I need you to stop talking" | "I need to be heard" or "I need rest" |
| "I need you to apologize" | "I need acknowledgment of impact" |
| "I need everyone to follow the rules" | "I need safety and predictability" |

**Rosenberg's universal needs (examples):**
- **Autonomy** — choice, freedom, independence
- **Integrity** — authenticity, creativity, meaning, self-worth
- **Interdependence** — acceptance, appreciation, closeness, community, consideration, contribution, emotional safety, empathy, honesty, love, reassurance, respect, support, trust, understanding, warmth
- **Physical nurturance** — air, food, movement, rest, safety, shelter, touch, water
- **Play** — fun, laughter
- **Spiritual communion** — beauty, harmony, inspiration, order, peace

**Why needs matter:**
- Needs are universal — we all share them
- Conflict is about strategies, not needs (we can all agree we need safety; we may disagree about how)
- When we connect at the level of needs, empathy emerges

### 4. Requests (Not Demands)

**Request:** Can be declined without negative consequences.
**Demand:** Cannot be declined without punishment or guilt.

**Characteristics of clear requests:**
- **Concrete** — specific action, not vague ("be more respectful")
- **Doable** — the person can actually do it
- **In the present or near future** — not "always" or "never"
- **Positive language** — what you want, not what you don't want

| ❌ Demand/Vague | ✅ Request |
|---|---|
| "Respect me" | "Would you be willing to wait until I finish speaking before responding?" |
| "Don't be late" | "Could we agree to a check-in time of 3pm?" |
| "You have to fix this" | "Would you be willing to meet with me to discuss how we can address this?" |

**The crucial question:** Can they say no?
- If no = punishment, it's a demand
- If no = we find another strategy, it's a request

---

## The NVC Formula

**Expressing ourselves:**
> "When I see/hear [observation], I feel [feeling] because I need [need]. Would you be willing to [request]?"

**Example:**
> "When I notice that project deadlines have been missed three times this month [observation], I feel anxious and concerned [feeling] because I need reliability and trust that our agreements are meaningful [needs]. Would you be willing to talk with me about what's making it hard to meet deadlines and what support might help? [request]"

**Empathic listening (guessing others' feelings and needs):**
> "Are you feeling [feeling] because you need [need]?"

---

## NVC in Conflict and Difficult Conversations

Rosenberg saw conflict as **a tragic expression of unmet needs**.

### Empathy Before Education

**Rosenberg's principle:**
- When someone is in pain, they can't hear you
- Empathy first (connect to their feelings and needs)
- Then problem-solving or requests

**This means:**
- Don't jump to solutions
- Don't defend yourself immediately
- Listen for the needs under their words
- Reflect back what you hear

**Example:**
- **Student (angry):** "You don't care about us! You just want us to follow your stupid rules!"
- **Unhelpful response:** "That's not true, I care a lot!" (defending)
- **NVC response:** "Are you feeling frustrated because you need to know that your wellbeing matters more than compliance?" (empathy)

### The Dance of Empathy and Honesty

NVC alternates between:
- **Empathy** — connecting to the other person's feelings and needs
- **Honesty** — expressing your own feelings and needs

**Both are essential:**
- Empathy without honesty = self-abandonment
- Honesty without empathy = demands

## The Jackal and the Giraffe

Rosenberg used puppets to teach NVC:

**Jackal (violent communication):**
- Judgments, blame, labels
- Demands, ultimatums
- Right/wrong thinking
- "You're being manipulative"

**Giraffe (nonviolent communication):**
- Observations, feelings, needs
- Requests
- Curiosity about needs
- "When I notice X, I feel Y because I need Z"

**The practice:**
- Notice when you're in jackal mode
- Translate to giraffe
- Offer yourself empathy first if needed
- Connect to needs (yours and theirs)

---

## Self-Empathy: The Foundation

Before we can offer empathy to others, we need **self-empathy**.

### What Is Self-Empathy?

Connecting to your own feelings and needs with compassion.

**Not self-empathy:**
- "I'm so stupid for feeling this way"
- "I shouldn't be upset"
- "Suck it up"

**Self-empathy:**
- "I'm feeling scared because I need safety"
- "I'm feeling frustrated because I need to matter"
- "I'm overwhelmed because I need rest and support"

**Why it matters:**
- You can't give what you don't have
- Self-empathy prevents burnout
- When your needs are acknowledged (by you), you can respond rather than react

---

## Mourning and Celebrating

Rosenberg taught **mourning** (connecting to pain when needs aren't met) and **celebrating** (connecting to joy when needs are met).

### Mourning (Not Shame)

**When a need wasn't met:**
- **Shame/blame:** "I'm a terrible person"
- **Mourning:** "I feel sad because I want to contribute to others' wellbeing, and my actions didn't align with that"

**Mourning allows:**
- Accountability without shame
- Learning without self-attack
- Repair and growth

### Celebrating

**When a need is met:**
- Notice and savor
- "I feel joyful because my need for connection was met"
- Gratitude rooted in needs

## Applied to The Multiverse School

### When Someone's Behavior Concerns Us, We Observe Rather Than Diagnose

**Jackal (pathologizing):**
- "This student is manipulative"
- "They have BPD"
- "They're attention-seeking"

**Giraffe (observing):**
- "When I notice [specific behavior], I feel concerned because our community needs safety/trust/accessibility"
- "I'm observing [pattern] and I'm curious about what needs aren't being met"

See: [Liberatory Practice](liberatory-practice.md)

### We Name Impact Without Pathologizing

**Not NVC:**
- "You're being disrespectful"
- "You're violating community norms"

**NVC:**
- "When interruptions happen frequently in class, I notice that some students stop participating. I'm concerned because I value everyone's voice being heard. Would you be willing to wait until others finish speaking before you respond?"

### We Connect to Universal Needs

**In conflict:**
- Don't argue about strategies ("You should do X")
- Connect to needs ("We all need safety. Let's talk about how to create that")
- Find strategies that meet everyone's needs where possible

### Boundaries Are Clear Requests, Not Punishments

**Demand:**
- "Stop doing that or you're out"
- Consequences are punishment

**Boundary as request:**
- "I need [need]. I'm requesting [concrete action]. If that's not possible for you, we may need to find a different path."
- Consequences protect needs, not punish

---

## NVC and Power Dynamics

Rosenberg addressed power in relationships.

### Protective vs. Punitive Force

**Punitive force:**
- Intended to cause suffering
- Meant to make someone regret their action
- Coercion through pain

**Protective force:**
- Intended to prevent harm
- Not meant to cause suffering
- Last resort when dialogue isn't possible

**Example:**
- **Punitive:** "You violated the rule, so now you suffer (suspension, humiliation)"
- **Protective:** "I'm stepping in to stop this harm from continuing. When there's safety, we can talk about what happened."

### When Someone Has More Power

**Person with more power:**
- Easy to turn requests into demands
- Must be clear: "You can say no to this"
- Must be willing to hear no
- Acknowledge the power difference

**In The Multiverse:**
- Facilitators have more power (institutional, social, knowledge)
- We name this rather than pretending it doesn't exist
- We make power accountable and transparent

## Limitations and Critiques

**Some critiques of NVC:**
- Can feel formulaic or robotic when first learning
- Requires both parties to engage (doesn't work with someone determined to cause harm)
- Developed in Western, individualist context
- Can be used to tone-police marginalized people
- Takes time (not always available in crisis)

**Our response:**
- Use the spirit of NVC, not rigid formula
- NVC is one tool among many
- Integrate with other frameworks (Freire, hooks, Indigenous)
- Don't use NVC to silence righteous anger at injustice
- Adapt NVC to context

## Reflection Questions

When applying NVC, ask:

1. **Observation or evaluation?** — Am I describing what I see/hear, or judging?
2. **Feeling or thought?** — Am I naming an emotion, or a mental interpretation?
3. **Need or strategy?** — Am I identifying a universal need, or a specific solution?
4. **Request or demand?** — Can they say no without consequences?
5. **Empathy given?** — Have I connected to their feelings and needs?
6. **Self-empathy?** — Have I connected to my own feelings and needs?
7. **Whose needs?** — Am I considering all needs (mine, theirs, community)?
8. **Power acknowledged?** — Have I named the power dynamics at play?
