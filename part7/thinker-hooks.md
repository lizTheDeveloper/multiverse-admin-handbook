# bell hooks: Love as Political Practice, Education as Freedom

## Who Was bell hooks?

bell hooks (1952-2021), born Gloria Jean Watkins, was a Black feminist writer, cultural critic, and educator whose work transformed how we understand love, teaching, and liberation. She intentionally used lowercase letters for her name to center her ideas over her identity.

**Key works:**
- *Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom* (1994)
- *All About Love: New Visions* (2000)
- *Feminism is for Everybody* (2000)
- *The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love* (2004)
- *Belonging: A Culture of Place* (2009)

hooks built on Paulo Freire's work while bringing feminist, Black, and Southern working-class perspectives. She challenged Freire's limitations (gendered language, male-centered examples) while expanding liberatory pedagogy to address race, gender, class, and the soul.

## Engaged Pedagogy: Teaching as Liberatory Practice

hooks calls her approach **engaged pedagogy** — teaching that respects and cares for the souls of students.

### What Is Engaged Pedagogy?

> "To teach in a manner that respects and cares for the souls of our students is essential if we are to provide the necessary conditions where learning can most deeply and intimately begin."

**Engaged pedagogy requires:**

**1. The teacher's wellbeing and self-actualization**
- You can't give what you don't have
- Teachers must tend their own spirits to teach well
- Burnout prevents engaged teaching
- Self-care is not optional — it's essential to the work

**2. Recognition of everyone's presence in the classroom**
- Every person's full humanity is honored
- Bodies, emotions, spirits are welcomed (not just minds)
- We bring our whole selves to learning

**3. Integration of mind, body, and spirit**
- Learning is not just intellectual
- We learn through emotion, intuition, embodiment
- Anti-Cartesian: we are not minds piloting meat suits

**4. Passionate learning, not drudgery**
- Education should excite, not bore
- Excitement about ideas is contagious
- Learning is a practice of freedom, not compliance

**5. Love as the foundation of learning**
- Love is not sentiment — it's practice
- Caring for students' growth and wholeness
- Creating conditions where souls can flourish

## Love as Political Practice

hooks' most revolutionary contribution: **love is political practice, not just personal feeling**.

### Love as Action, Not Feeling

From *All About Love*:

> "Love is as love does. Love is an act of will — namely, both an intention and an action."

**What love is NOT:**
- Sentiment or warm feelings
- Enabling or rescuing
- Avoiding conflict
- Being nice all the time
- Accepting harmful behavior

**What love IS:**
- Intention + action for someone's growth
- Commitment to truth-telling
- Care enough to confront harm
- Creating conditions for flourishing
- Combination of care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust

### The Will to Nurture Spiritual Growth

hooks defines love as:

> "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth."

**Applied to teaching:**
- We care about students' growth, not just their performance
- We confront behaviors that limit their freedom
- We create conditions for transformation
- We hold students accountable because we love them

---

## Love and Boundaries: The Fierce Work

One of hooks' most important teachings for educators:

> "When we love we are able to be courageous enough to confront harsh truths. We can speak from the heart and share words that are confrontational and even critical. Love allows us to speak with care and to not be punitive, to be compassionate and empathetic."

**This means:**

### Boundaries Are Acts of Love

**NOT love:**
- Tolerating harm to avoid conflict
- Sacrificing community safety for one person
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Enabling harmful behavior

**IS love:**
- Saying "this behavior harms community"
- Setting clear boundaries
- Holding people accountable
- Protecting collective wellbeing

### Confronting Harm Is Caring

- We care enough to tell the truth
- We speak from the heart, not to punish
- We can be compassionate AND confrontational
- Avoiding confrontation is avoiding love

**In The Multiverse:**
- When we say "you can't participate in community this way," that's love
- When we set boundaries, we're protecting the collective (including the person causing harm)
- Daring to love deeply means daring to be accountable

## Education as the Practice of Freedom

hooks built on Freire's framework while addressing its gaps.

### What She Kept from Freire

- Education as dialogue, not monologue
- Banking model critique
- Liberation through critical consciousness
- Co-creation of knowledge

### What She Added

**1. Feminism and intersectionality**
- Race, class, gender, sexuality intersect
- White supremacist capitalist patriarchy as system
- Black feminist thought as liberatory

**2. Eros and passion in learning**
- Excitement is part of learning
- Bodies and emotions matter
- Learning should feel alive, not deadening

**3. The teacher's wholeness**
- Freire didn't adequately address teacher self-care
- Teachers must be whole to teach
- Engaged pedagogy requires self-actualization

**4. Love as explicit practice**
- Freire implied love but didn't center it
- hooks makes love the foundation

## The Teacher's Wholeness: You Can't Pour from an Empty Cup

hooks insists that teachers must tend their own spirits.

### Why Teacher Wholeness Matters

> "Engaged pedagogy does not seek simply to empower students. Any classroom that employs a holistic model of learning will also be a place where teachers grow, and are empowered by the process."

**This means:**
- Teaching is not self-sacrifice
- Your wellbeing enables your teaching
- Burnout serves no one
- Self-actualization is part of the work

### What Teachers Need

**From *Teaching to Transgress*:**
- Passion for the subject matter
- Commitment to self-actualization
- Spiritual practice or groundedness
- Community and support
- Permission to bring whole self to teaching
- Time for reflection and renewal

**In The Multiverse:**
- See [Burnout Prevention & Recognition](../part5/burnout-prevention.md)
- See [Boundaries for Educators](../part5/teacher-boundaries.md)
- Teacher self-care is not optional

## Eros in the Classroom: Passion and Aliveness

hooks reclaims **eros** (life force, passion, aliveness) in teaching.

### What Is Eros in Learning?

Not sexual — but the **aliveness, excitement, and passion** that makes learning transformative.

**hooks writes:**
> "Professors who embrace the challenge of self-actualization will be better able to create pedagogical practices that engage students, providing them with ways of knowing that enhance their capacity to live fully and deeply."

**This means:**
- Learning should feel exciting, not deadening
- Passion for ideas is contagious
- We bring energy and aliveness to learning spaces
- Education engages the whole person (mind, body, spirit)

**What kills eros:**
- Treating education as information transfer
- Boring, rote learning
- Disconnection from real life
- Pretending to be neutral or objective
- Teachers going through the motions

**What cultivates eros:**
- Genuine curiosity and excitement
- Vulnerable, authentic teaching
- Connecting learning to students' lives
- Bringing your passion to the classroom
- Making space for surprise and emergence

## Talking Back: Voice and Agency

From *Talking Back: Thinking Feminist, Thinking Black*:

**"Talking back" means:**
- Speaking as an equal
- Refusing to be silenced
- Claiming voice and agency
- Resisting domination

**In education:**
- Students "talk back" to dominant narratives
- Students question what they're taught
- Voice is central to liberation
- We create conditions where marginalized voices are centered

**In The Multiverse:**
- We want students to question us
- Critical thinking includes questioning facilitators
- "Talking back" is growth, not disrespect
- Disagreement is welcomed (see [Liberatory Practice](liberatory-practice.md))

---

## Building Community in the Classroom

hooks emphasizes that learning happens in community.

### Community as Classroom

**Principles:**
- Everyone contributes
- Everyone's presence matters
- We build together, not in isolation
- Learning is relational
- Community requires commitment

**What this looks like:**
- Circle practices, not lecture halls
- Dialogue, not monologue
- Shared authority
- Collective knowledge-building
- Care for each other's growth

### Differences and Conflict

hooks doesn't romanticize community — she acknowledges conflict.

**From her work:**
- Differences will emerge
- Conflict is part of community
- We learn to be in conflict together
- Avoiding conflict prevents growth
- Truth-telling can be uncomfortable AND necessary

---

## Addressing Race, Class, Gender in the Classroom

hooks insists that education cannot be neutral about oppression.

### Naming White Supremacist Capitalist Patriarchy

She uses the phrase **"white supremacist capitalist patriarchy"** to name the interlocking system.

**Why this matters:**
- We can't pretend education is apolitical
- Silence about oppression serves oppression
- We name systems, not just individual prejudices
- Education either reproduces or challenges domination

### Creating Liberatory Spaces for Marginalized Students

**hooks' guidance:**
- Center marginalized voices
- Don't expect Black/queer/disabled students to educate others
- Address racism, sexism, ableism when they show up
- Create spaces where everyone can bring their full selves
- Recognize that safety looks different for different people

**In The Multiverse:**
- We name power and oppression
- We center neurodivergent, queer, Black, Indigenous, disabled voices
- We don't ask marginalized students to perform their identities
- We challenge ableism, racism, transphobia when they emerge

---

## Solitude and Love

From *All About Love*:

> "Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving. When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape."

**Why this matters for educators:**
- We must be okay alone to be present with students
- If we need students to validate us, we use them
- Solitude prevents codependence
- We come to teaching from wholeness, not neediness

**Applied to boundaries:**
- We don't need students to like us
- We can hold boundaries without fear of abandonment
- We don't rescue students to feel needed
- Our worth isn't dependent on student outcomes

---

## Applied to The Multiverse School

### Boundaries Are Acts of Love, Not Control

**Banking/hierarchical approach:**
- "I'm setting this boundary to control you"
- Boundaries as punishment

**hooks-inspired approach:**
- "This boundary protects our collective wellbeing"
- "I care about you AND I care about community safety"
- "Love includes saying 'this behavior harms others'"

### We Care Enough to Confront When Harm Occurs

**Avoiding confrontation:**
- "I don't want to hurt their feelings"
- "Maybe it'll get better on its own"
- "I don't want conflict"

**Loving confrontation:**
- "I notice [observation]. This impacts community by [impact]. Can we talk about this?"
- "I care about you, which is why I'm bringing this up"
- "This behavior doesn't align with who I know you want to be"

### Facilitators Must Tend Their Own Spirits to Teach Well

**From hooks:**
- Teacher burnout prevents engaged pedagogy
- You can't give what you don't have
- Self-actualization is part of the work

**In The Multiverse:**
- [Burnout Prevention](../part5/burnout-prevention.md) is not optional
- Take breaks, set boundaries, tend your spirit
- Your wholeness enables your teaching

### Learning Communities Succeed When Everyone's Humanity Is Honored

**What this means:**
- We recognize neurodivergent ways of being
- We welcome bodies, emotions, spirits (not just minds)
- We honor different learning styles
- We create conditions where everyone can show up fully

### We Dare to Love Deeply — Which Includes Saying "This Behavior Harms Community"

**The paradox:**
- Love includes boundaries
- Care includes confrontation
- Holding someone accountable is an act of love

## Key Quotes to Ground Us

> "The classroom remains the most radical space of possibility in the academy."

> "What we do is more important than what we say or what we say we believe."

> "Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving."

> "Love is a combination of care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust."

> "Rarely, if ever, are any of us healed in isolation. Healing is an act of communion."

> "The function of art is to do more than tell it like it is — it's to imagine what is possible."

> "When we drop fear, we can draw nearer to people, we can draw nearer to the earth, we can draw nearer to all the heavenly creatures that surround us."

## Critiques and Limitations

**Some critiques:**
- Later work became more spiritual/abstract
- Less focus on concrete organizing strategies
- Can feel individualistic at times (though rooted in collective)
- Not as much focus on disability as on race/gender/class

**Our response:**
- We integrate her work with others (Freire, Goldman, Indigenous frameworks)
- We ground her principles in concrete practice
- We extend her work to include neurodivergence and disability justice
- We honor what she gave us while continuing to build

## Reflection Questions

When applying hooks' framework, ask:

1. **Wholeness** — Am I bringing my whole self to this? Am I tending my own spirit?
2. **Love as practice** — Am I practicing love (care + accountability) or just being nice?
3. **Boundaries** — Are my boundaries protecting collective wellbeing?
4. **Confrontation** — Am I avoiding necessary confrontation? Can I confront with compassion?
5. **Eros** — Is there aliveness in this learning space?
6. **Community** — Are we building together or am I depositing knowledge?
7. **Voice** — Whose voices are centered? Who gets to "talk back"?
8. **Solitude** — Can I be alone, or do I need students to validate me?
