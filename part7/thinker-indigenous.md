# Indigenous Perspectives: Relational Accountability & Healing-Centered Practice

## Understanding Indigenous Pedagogy

Indigenous pedagogies represent thousands of years of wisdom about learning, relationship, and knowledge transmission. These are not monolithic — different Indigenous nations have distinct practices — but common threads emerge across Indigenous educational traditions worldwide.

**Important note:** This document draws on scholarship by Indigenous educators and researchers, recognizing that we (The Multiverse School) are learning from these traditions with respect and humility, not claiming to represent them.

## Traditional Indigenous Learning Practices

### Learning Through Observation and Practice

Traditional Indigenous learning commonly involves **"observation, supervised participation, and private self-testing"** rather than direct instruction.

**Core method:**
1. **Observation** — Watch skilled practitioners
2. **Supervised practice** — Try the skill with guidance nearby
3. **Private self-testing** — Practice independently
4. **Reflection** — Consider what worked and what didn't
5. **Further action** — Continue refining

**Why this matters:**
- Learning is experiential, not abstract
- Students learn by doing, not by being told
- Knowledge is embodied and situated
- Failure is part of learning (private self-testing allows mistakes without shame)

**In The Multiverse:**
- Project-based learning over lectures
- Apprenticeship and mentorship models
- Space for experimentation and failure
- Learning integrated with real work

### Role of Elders

In Indigenous communities, **Elders are the most respected educators**.

**Elders' role:**
- Pass wisdom and knowledge to youth
- Model values and practices
- Offer guidance, not commands
- Share stories that contain teachings
- Create conditions for learning

**Not hierarchical authority:**
- Elders don't command obedience
- Respect is earned through wisdom and character
- Teaching through example and story
- Learners choose when to seek guidance

**In The Multiverse:**
- We honor lived experience and elder knowledge
- We learn from those who've walked the path
- Authority comes from wisdom, not title
- Facilitators as guides, not commanders

### Place-Based and Experiential Learning

Indigenous pedagogies **connect learning to specific places** — knowledge is situated in relationship to location, experience, and community.

**Place-based learning:**
- Knowledge emerges from land and place
- Learning happens in context, not abstraction
- Relationship to environment is central
- Sustainability and stewardship are taught through practice

**In online/distributed learning:**
- We honor students' local contexts
- We encourage learning rooted in students' actual lives
- We connect technical skills to real community needs
- We don't extract learning from life

## Relational Accountability: "All My Relations"

Central to many Indigenous worldviews: **"All my relations"** (*Mitakuye Oyasin* in Lakota).

### What Is Relational Accountability?

From Indigenous healing and education frameworks:

> "Healing incorporates physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions through relationships which occur alongside the healing journey."

**Relational accountability means:**
- We are interconnected, not separate individuals
- Responsibility to nurture relationships, not just achieve outcomes
- Spiritual, emotional, mental, physical wellness are inseparable
- Community healing, not just individual "treatment"
- Honoring ancestral knowledge and lived experience
- Accountability to past, present, and future generations

### We Are Responsible to All Our Relations

**Relations include:**
- Human community (family, friends, community members)
- Ancestors and future generations
- Land, water, air
- Animals, plants, all living beings
- Spirit world

**This is not metaphor:**
- Our actions affect the web of relationships
- Individual wellbeing is inseparable from collective wellbeing
- Healing happens in connection, not isolation
- When one suffers, all suffer; when one heals, all benefit

### Applied to Education

**Relational accountability in learning:**
- Learning is relational (we learn with and from each other)
- We're accountable to our learning community
- Our growth affects others' growth
- Knowledge carries responsibility
- We consider impact on future learners

**In The Multiverse:**
- Individual healing happens in community context
- One person's crisis affects the collective
- We balance individual needs with collective wellbeing
- We ask "How does this affect all our relations?"
- See: [Liberatory Practice](liberatory-practice.md) — Question #5

## Healing-Centered vs. Trauma-Informed Practice

Indigenous frameworks distinguish **healing-centered** from **trauma-informed** approaches.

### The Difference

**Trauma-informed asks:**
- "What's wrong with you?"
- "What trauma did you experience?"
- Focus on pathology and diagnosis

**Healing-centered asks:**
- "What happened to you?" (context and history)
- "What is right with you?" (strengths and resilience)
- "What healing do you need?" (support and growth)
- Focus on wholeness and community care

### Why This Matters

**Trauma-informed approaches:**
- Can still pathologize
- Focus on individual "symptoms"
- Risk extracting trauma narratives
- May not honor resilience

**Healing-centered approaches:**
- Honor what kept you alive
- Recognize survival strategies
- Center community and culture
- Ask about conditions for flourishing

**From scholar Shawn Ginwright (2018):**

> "Trauma-informed care locates the problem in the individual. Healing-centered engagement is more holistic and relational, asking not 'What's wrong with you?' but 'What healing do you need?'"

## Decolonizing Mental Health

Indigenous perspectives challenge Western psychiatric frameworks.

### DSM-5 Pathologizes What Colonialism Creates

**Critical insight:**
- The DSM-5 was created in a colonial, white supremacist context
- "Mental illness" is often rational response to oppression
- Diagnosis can be tool of social control
- Indigenous, Black, queer, neurodivergent ways of being are not inherently pathological

**Historical context:**
- Enslaved people who escaped were diagnosed with "drapetomania" (disease causing slaves to flee)
- Homosexuality was in the DSM until 1973
- Hysteria was used to pathologize women's anger
- Indigenous spiritual practices were labeled "psychotic"

**Today:**
- Poverty, racism, and violence create "symptoms"
- We call oppression's effects "disorders"
- We medicalize what we should politicize

### Not Everything Needs a Diagnosis

From Indigenous wisdom: **Not everything needs a diagnosis.**

**Alternative frameworks:**
- Spiritual emergence (what psychiatry calls "psychosis" may be spiritual awakening)
- Ancestral calling (visions, voices may be connection to ancestors)
- Breaking free from oppression (what looks like "instability" may be liberation)
- Neurodivergence as difference, not disorder
- "Madness" as wisdom, rebellion, or survival

**This doesn't mean:**
- Ignoring suffering
- Refusing medical help when wanted
- Romanticizing pain

**It means:**
- Diagnosis is a tool, not the truth
- Multiple frameworks can coexist
- The person defines their own experience
- We ask "What do you need?" not "What's your diagnosis?"

### Healing Happens in Community and Through Reconnection

**Indigenous healing practices emphasize:**
- Connection to community, not isolation
- Reconnection to culture, land, ancestors
- Ceremony and ritual
- Holistic approaches (mind, body, spirit, relationships)
- Collective healing, not just individual therapy

**Research findings:**
- Social connection reduces "mental illness" symptoms
- Cultural reconnection improves wellbeing for Indigenous people
- Community-based healing often more effective than individual therapy
- Relational trauma heals in relational safety

## Applied to The Multiverse School

### We Don't Diagnose — We Witness and Support

**Pathology approach:**
- "This student has BPD"
- "They're showing signs of schizophrenia"
- Label and manage

**Healing-centered approach:**
- "This person is in pain and their coping strategies are affecting community"
- "What happened to them? What do they need?"
- Observe patterns, connect to needs (NVC), offer support

**See:**
- [Understanding Borderline Patterns](borderline-personality-disorder.md)
- [Understanding Schizophrenia & Psychosis](schizophrenia-psychosis.md)
- [Understanding Dependent Patterns](dependent-personality-disorder.md)

(All three sections apply healing-centered framing)

### "Crisis" May Be Spiritual Emergence, Ancestral Calling, or Breaking Free

**Medical model:**
- Psychosis = brain disease
- Mania = chemical imbalance
- Requires pharmaceutical intervention

**Alternative frameworks:**
- May be spiritual emergence
- May be ancestral calling
- May be breaking free from oppression
- May be neurodivergent way of processing
- May be all of these things simultaneously

**Our approach:**
- Honor multiple frameworks
- Ask the person how they understand their experience
- Offer resources (including crisis support if needed)
- Don't impose interpretation

**See:**
- [Schizophrenia & Psychosis](schizophrenia-psychosis.md) — Mad Pride section
- [Responding to Crisis](../part3/suicidal-students.md)

### Healing Is Relational: You Heal in Connection, Not Isolation

**Isolation model:**
- Individual therapy
- "Fix yourself"
- Disconnection during crisis

**Relational model:**
- Community care
- "We heal together"
- Connection during crisis (with boundaries)

**In The Multiverse:**
- We don't isolate people in crisis (unless they want space)
- We offer community support
- We recognize individual healing affects collective
- We practice mutual aid (see [Mutual Aid Guidelines](../part4/mutual-aid-guidelines.md))

### We Ask "What Conditions Would Support Your Flourishing?" Not "What's Your Diagnosis?"

**Diagnosis-centered:**
- "Tell me your diagnoses so I know how to accommodate you"

**Needs-centered:**
- "What do you need to thrive here?"
- "What conditions support your learning?"
- "What hasn't worked for you in the past?"

**Why:**
- Diagnosis may or may not be relevant
- Person knows their needs better than any label
- We create conditions for flourishing, not manage symptoms

## Montessori and Indigenous Pedagogy: Shared Wisdom

You asked about Montessori's indigenous roots. The research shows:

### Not Historically Derived, But Remarkably Aligned

Maria Montessori (1870-1952) developed her pedagogy in Italy, drawing primarily from European scientific observation of children. **She did not derive her methods from Indigenous practices.**

**However:** There are striking overlaps between Montessori principles and traditional Indigenous learning practices.

### Shared Values and Practices

**Both emphasize:**

**1. Observation and self-directed learning**
- Indigenous: Children learn through observation and private self-testing
- Montessori: Prepared environment where children choose activities and learn through doing

**2. Mixed-age communities**
- Indigenous: Extended family learning (all ages learn together)
- Montessori: Multi-age classrooms (typically 3-year spans)

**3. Hands-on, experiential learning**
- Indigenous: Learning by doing real work
- Montessori: Practical life activities, sensorial materials

**4. Respect for the child's autonomy**
- Indigenous: Children as capable agents, not objects to be molded
- Montessori: "Help me do it myself" — child-directed development

**5. Connection to environment**
- Indigenous: Place-based learning, relationship to land
- Montessori: Prepared environment, care for materials and nature

**6. Intrinsic motivation**
- Indigenous: Learning emerges from natural curiosity and participation
- Montessori: No rewards/punishments, self-motivation

### Indigenous Montessori Movement

Contemporary Indigenous educators are **reclaiming and combining both traditions**:

**Indigenous Montessori Institute (IMI):**
- Founded by Trisha Moquino (Keres/Laguna Pueblo)
- Combines Indigenous knowledge systems with Montessori philosophy
- Keres Children's Learning Center: Keres language immersion + Montessori pedagogy
- Anti-racist, anti-biased teacher training
- Decolonizing Montessori to center Indigenous values

**What this suggests:**
- Possible universal human wisdom about how children learn
- Different cultures arriving at similar principles
- Not appropriation, but convergent practices
- Opportunity to learn from both traditions

### Learning from Both Traditions

**In The Multiverse:**
- We honor Indigenous pedagogies as original wisdom
- We recognize overlaps with other liberatory education (Montessori, Freire, etc.)
- We learn from Indigenous educators leading this work
- We don't claim Indigenous practices, but we learn from them with respect

## The Four Rs of Indigenous Education

From Blackfoot educator Leroy Little Bear and others: **Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, Responsibility**.

### 1. Respect
- For Elders, knowledge keepers, community
- For different ways of knowing
- For land, water, all living beings
- For each person's journey

### 2. Relevance
- Learning connected to students' lives and communities
- Knowledge serves the community
- Practical, applicable learning

### 3. Reciprocity
- Learning is mutual exchange
- Teachers learn from students
- Knowledge comes with responsibility to give back

### 4. Responsibility
- To ancestors, community, future generations
- To use knowledge well
- To contribute to collective wellbeing
- Relational accountability

**In The Multiverse:**
- We practice these Four Rs
- Respect for all ways of knowing
- Learning relevant to students' lives
- Mutual teaching and learning
- Responsibility to community and future

## Storytelling as Pedagogy

Indigenous education often uses **storytelling** as primary teaching method.

### Why Stories?

**Stories:**
- Contain layered teachings (you learn what you're ready to learn)
- Pass down cultural knowledge and values
- Are relational (told in community)
- Honor oral tradition
- Engage imagination and emotion
- Can be revisited at different life stages

**Not just entertainment:**
- Creation stories explain relationships
- Trickster stories teach about consequences
- Seasonal stories connect to cycles
- Personal stories transmit experience

**In The Multiverse:**
- We use case studies and scenarios (see [Part VI](../part6/case-aspiring-guru.md))
- We share stories of what worked and what didn't
- We honor storytelling as knowledge transmission

---

## Critiques of "Using" Indigenous Frameworks

### Appropriation vs. Learning

**Appropriation:**
- Taking Indigenous practices out of context
- Claiming Indigenous identity we don't have
- Commodifying sacred practices
- Extracting knowledge without relationship

**Respectful learning:**
- Acknowledging source and context
- Learning from Indigenous educators doing this work
- Not claiming to represent Indigenous knowledge
- Applying principles ethically in our context
- Supporting Indigenous-led education

**Our commitment:**
- We cite Indigenous scholars and educators
- We direct people to Indigenous-led resources
- We acknowledge what we're learning from
- We don't claim to teach Indigenous practices
- We apply principles with humility and accountability

## Reflection Questions

When applying Indigenous frameworks, ask:

1. **Relational accountability:** How does this affect all my relations?
2. **Healing-centered:** Am I asking "What healing do you need?" or "What's wrong with you?"
3. **Community:** Am I practicing collective care or individual pathology?
4. **Diagnosis:** Am I pathologizing what oppression creates?
5. **Decolonizing:** Am I challenging colonial frameworks or reproducing them?
6. **Respect:** Am I learning with humility and citing sources?
7. **Appropriation:** Am I taking without relationship, or learning with accountability?
8. **Neurodivergence:** Am I honoring different ways of being as valid?
