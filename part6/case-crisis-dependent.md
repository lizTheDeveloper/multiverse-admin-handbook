# Case Study: The Crisis-Dependent Student

## Overview

This case study illustrates how to recognize crisis dependency, set appropriate boundaries, and distinguish between genuine need and maladaptive patterns—while maintaining compassion.

**Key Lessons:**
- Crisis dependency is a pattern, not a character flaw
- Boundaries help, not harm
- Referring to appropriate support is care
- You can't rescue your way to student independence
- Documentation reveals patterns

## Week 3: First Crisis

### Crisis 1: Housing Emergency
**Date:** Week 3, Tuesday, 2:47am
**Platform:** Direct message to teacher Jamie

Morgan sends Jamie a long message:
> "I'm so sorry to message this late. I just got kicked out of where I was staying. I'm sitting in my car right now and I don't know where to go. I know you're probably asleep but I'm scared and you're the only person I feel safe talking to. I'm trying to stay calm but I'm having a panic attack. Can you help me figure out what to do?"

**Teacher Response (Next Morning, 9am):**
Jamie responds:
> "I'm sorry you went through that last night. That sounds really scary. Are you safe right now? Do you have somewhere you can go today?
>
> For housing emergencies, here are some resources:
> - [Local shelter hotline]
> - [Housing assistance program]
> - 211 (connects to local services)
> - 988 if you're in crisis
>
> I respond to messages during business hours (9am-6pm weekdays). If you need immediate support outside those hours, please use the crisis resources above."

**Morgan's Response:**
> "Thank you so much. I'm okay now, I ended up sleeping in my car. I called 211 and they helped me find a shelter. I'm sorry for messaging so late. I should have remembered your hours. Thank you for the resources."

**Documentation:**
Jamie logs the incident briefly: *"Morgan had housing crisis, messaged late at night (2:47am). Provided resources. They responded well to boundary reminder."*

**Assessment:** Normal crisis + appropriate boundary-setting. Monitoring.

---

## Week 4: Pattern Emerges

### Crisis 2: Can't Complete Assignment
**Date:** Week 4, Thursday, 7:

15pm

Morgan messages Jamie:
> "I'm so sorry but I can't finish this week's assignment. I've been so stressed about housing and I'm having really bad executive dysfunction and I just can't focus. I feel like I'm failing everyone. I'm trying so hard but nothing is working. I don't know if I should even be in this class. I'm probably wasting your time."

**Teacher Response:**
> "Housing instability absolutely affects your ability to focus—that's real. Here's what I can offer: an extension until Monday. That gives you the weekend.
>
> I can't offer indefinite flexibility, but I can offer this one extension. Does that help?"

**Morgan's Response:**
> "Yes, thank you so much. That really helps. I'll get it done this weekend."

---

### Crisis 3: Weekend Meltdown
**Date:** Week 4, Saturday, 11:34pm

Morgan sends Jamie three messages in rapid succession:
> "I can't do this"
>
> "I've been trying to work on the assignment all day and I just keep crying"
>
> "I'm sorry I'm such a mess. You're probably regretting letting me in this class"

**Teacher Response (Sunday morning, 10am):**
> "I see you're struggling. Here's what I need you to know:
> 1. You're not a mess—you're dealing with hard circumstances
> 2. I don't respond to messages on weekends. My hours are Monday-Friday 9-6.
> 3. If you're in crisis, please call 988 or Crisis Text Line (741741)
> 4. The assignment is still due Monday. If you can't complete it, that's okay—we'll discuss what's realistic for you going forward."

**Morgan's Response (Sunday, 2pm):**
> "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you on the weekend. I was just really overwhelmed. I'll have the assignment done tomorrow."

*Morgan submits a partial assignment Monday morning with a long note about how hard the weekend was.*

**Documentation:**
Jamie logs: *"Second late-night message from Morgan. Housing crisis is ongoing and affecting their work. Weekend messages despite boundary reminder. Emotional escalation when stressed. Extension granted, partial work submitted."*

**Assessment:** Pattern forming—crisis when deadlines approach, late-night contact despite boundaries, emotional escalation.

---

## Week 5: Escalation

### Crisis 4: "I Can't Handle This Class"
**Date:** Week 5, Tuesday, 4:22pm

Morgan emails Jamie (longer communication than usual):
> "I need to talk to you about whether I should stay in this class. I feel like I'm constantly behind and letting you down. Every time I try to work on something, I have a panic attack or I just shut down. I know you said you can't offer indefinite flexibility but I don't know how to function right now.
>
> I'm in between housing again. I'm staying with someone I met at the shelter but I don't know how long I can stay there. I haven't eaten today because I spent my last $10 on gas. I applied for SNAP but it's taking forever.
>
> I don't want to drop the class because this community is the only good thing in my life right now, but I also don't want to keep failing. Can we talk? When are you available?"

**Teacher Response:**
Jamie responds:
> "Morgan, I can hear you're dealing with a lot of intersecting crises right now—housing, food insecurity, and the stress is affecting your ability to complete coursework.
>
> Let's have a conversation. I have office hours Thursday 2-4pm. Can you make that time? We can talk about whether continuing right now is the best choice, or if taking a pause until things stabilize might be better.
>
> In the meantime:
> - **Food:** [Local food bank info, SNAP helpline]
> - **Crisis support:** 988 Lifeline, Crisis Text Line (741741)
> - **Housing:** 211, [local housing hotline]
>
> You're not failing me. You're navigating survival. Those are two different things."

**Morgan's Response:**
> "Yes, I can make Thursday at 2pm. Thank you for not giving up on me."

---

### The Conversation (Thursday, Week 5)

**Jamie (on Zoom call with Morgan):**
> "Thanks for making time to talk. I want to start by acknowledging: you're dealing with real, serious challenges. Housing and food insecurity are traumatic and exhausting. That's not something you can just 'push through.'
>
> Here's what I'm noticing: the class is adding stress instead of being supportive right now. You're spending energy worrying about assignments when you need that energy for survival stuff. Does that sound accurate?"

**Morgan:**
> "Yeah... I guess. But this class is the only thing that makes me feel normal. If I drop it, I have nothing."

**Jamie:**
> "I hear that this community matters to you. And also, participation in class requires a baseline of stability that you don't have right now. That's not your fault—but it's real.
>
> Here are your options:
> 1. **Take a pause.** Step away until your housing and food situation stabilizes. You can rejoin next session or when you're ready.
> 2. **Stay with very reduced expectations.** You participate when you can, but no pressure on assignments. You're here for community, not grades.
> 3. **Continue as-is, with the understanding that you may not complete the class.**
>
> What feels most realistic and sustainable for you?"

**Morgan:**
> "I don't want to leave. Can we do option 2? I just want to be part of the community."

**Jamie:**
> "Okay. Here's what that looks like:
> - You're welcome in class discussions when you can make it
> - No assignments required—you can submit if you want, but there's no pressure
> - If you need to miss class because of housing stuff, that's okay
> - You'll still have access to chat and resources
>
> BUT—and this is important—I need you to use crisis resources when you're in crisis, not message me. My role is to facilitate learning, not to be your crisis support. Does that make sense?"

**Morgan:**
> "Yeah, that makes sense. I'm sorry I've been messaging you so much."

**Jamie:**
> "You're not in trouble. I just want to make sure you have the right kind of support. 988 and Crisis Text Line are available 24/7. I'm not. Okay?"

**Morgan:**
> "Okay. Thank you."

**Documentation:**
Jamie documents the conversation fully, including the agreement about reduced expectations and boundary about crisis messaging.

## Week 6-7: Testing the Boundaries

### Crisis 5: Late Night "Emergency"
**Date:** Week 6, Friday, 1:03am

Morgan messages Jamie:
> "I know you're not available right now but I just need to tell someone. The place I was staying, the guy tried to assault me tonight. I got out and I'm safe but I'm sitting in a 24-hour diner and I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone else to talk to."

**Teacher Response (Saturday morning, 9:30am):**
> "Morgan, I'm really sorry that happened to you. That's traumatic and scary.
>
> This is exactly the kind of situation where you need to contact crisis support:
> - 988 Lifeline (24/7)
> - Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
> - RAINN (sexual assault hotline): 800-656-4673
> - Local domestic violence hotline: [number]
>
> Did you call any of those resources last night? Are you safe right now?"

**Morgan's Response (Saturday, 11am):**
> "No, I didn't call anyone. I just sat in the diner until morning and then went to the shelter. I'm okay now. I'm sorry for messaging you again in the middle of the night."

**Jamie's Response:**
> "I need to be really clear: when something like that happens, you MUST call 988 or a crisis line. I can't provide that kind of support.
>
> I care about your safety. That's exactly why I'm insisting you use resources designed for this. They have trained people available 24/7. I don't.
>
> Going forward, if you message me about a crisis outside my hours, I'm going to respond with crisis resources and nothing else. Not because I don't care, but because you need actual crisis support, not a teacher."

**Morgan's Response:**
> "I understand. I'll call next time."

**Documentation:**
Jamie logs: *"Morgan disclosed assault, messaged at 1am despite previous boundaries. Did not use crisis resources. Reinforced boundary—future crisis messages will only receive resource referrals, no other engagement."*

**Assessment:** Morgan is testing whether Jamie will make exceptions during "real" crises. Pattern: crises when seeking connection/support.

---

## Week 8: The Boundary Holds

### Crisis 6: Suicidal Ideation
**Date:** Week 8, Wednesday, 10:47pm

Morgan messages Jamie:
> "I can't do this anymore. I'm so tired. I don't want to be alive. I'm not going to do anything tonight but I just wanted someone to know."

**Teacher Response (Immediate, even though outside hours—because suicidal ideation):**
> "Morgan, I'm taking this seriously. Please call or text 988 right now. They can help you through this.
>
> If you're not safe, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.
>
> I'm also notifying [admin name] so you have additional support."

*Jamie immediately messages admin:*
> "Morgan expressed suicidal ideation via DM at 10:47pm. I responded with 988 referral and told them I'm notifying you. They said they won't act tonight but I want to escalate for safety."

**Morgan's Response (11:32pm):**
> "I'm okay. I called the crisis line. The person I talked to was really helpful. I'm not going to hurt myself. I'm sorry for scaring you."

**Jamie's Response:**
> "I'm glad you called and that they were helpful. That's exactly what those resources are for.
>
> [Admin] and I are going to talk tomorrow about how to support you going forward. Take care of yourself tonight."

---

### Admin Intervention (Next Day)

**Admin (Ann) calls Morgan:**
> "Hey Morgan, Jamie let me know about last night. I'm glad you're safe and that you called the crisis line.
>
> Here's what I need you to know: We care about you, and we want you to be part of this community. We're also not equipped to be your primary support system when you're in crisis.
>
> Going forward:
> - When you're in crisis, you call 988 first, not teachers
> - If you continue to message teachers about crises instead of using resources, we'll need to pause your participation
> - We want you here, and we need you to use appropriate support
>
> Can you commit to that?"

**Morgan:**
> "Yes. I'm sorry. I know I've been too much."

**Ann:**
> "You're not 'too much.' You're dealing with a lot. We just need you to get support from people trained for it. Fair?"

**Morgan:**
> "Fair."

---

## Week 9-10: Stability Emerges

### What Changed
After the admin intervention, Morgan:
- Stopped late-night messaging (mostly)
- Started mentioning calling 988 when struggling
- Participated in class when they could, without constant apologies
- Seemed less focused on getting validation from Jamie specifically
- Built some connections with other students

**One incident (Week 9):**
Morgan messaged Jamie at 11pm: *"Having a hard night"*

**Jamie responded (next morning):**
> "I hope you called 988 or Crisis Text Line."

**Morgan:**
> "I did! They were helpful. Just wanted to let you know I'm okay."

**Analysis:** Morgan is learning to use appropriate resources and just updating Jamie (not seeking rescue).

---

## Week 12: Check-In Conversation

**Jamie reaches out:**
> "Hey Morgan, I wanted to check in. I've noticed you seem more stable the last few weeks. How are things going?"

**Morgan:**
> "Things are still hard but I'm managing better. I got into a transitional housing program, which helps. And I've been using the crisis line when I'm overwhelmed instead of spiraling alone.
>
> I'm sorry I was so much at the beginning. I think I was looking for you to save me, and that wasn't fair to you."

**Jamie:**
> "I appreciate you saying that. I can see you're doing the work to build a support network beyond just one person. That's huge.
>
> How's class feeling for you now?"

**Morgan:**
> "Honestly, taking the pressure off assignments helped. I can just participate when I have capacity. Some weeks that's a lot, some weeks it's nothing. But I don't feel like I'm failing anymore."

**Jamie:**
> "That's exactly what we hoped for. You're welcome to stay in this reduced-expectations mode as long as you need. When your housing is more stable, we can talk about returning to full participation if you want."

**Morgan:**
> "Thank you for not giving up on me."

**Jamie:**
> "I didn't give up on you—I held boundaries so you could stay. There's a difference."

## Analysis: What Went Right

### 1. Early Boundary Setting
- Jamie set office hours/response times from the start
- Consistently redirected crisis messages to appropriate resources
- Didn't waiver when Morgan had "real" emergencies

### 2. Flexibility Within Structure
- Offered reduced expectations when full participation wasn't realistic
- Allowed Morgan to stay connected to community without assignment pressure
- Acknowledged the reality of housing/food instability

### 3. Admin Support
- Jamie escalated when suicidal ideation emerged
- Admin reinforced boundaries without shaming Morgan
- Shared responsibility (not all on one teacher)

### 4. Consistent Messaging
- Every crisis message got the same response: crisis resources
- No special treatment during "big" crises vs. "small" crises
- Clear, repeated boundary: "I'm your teacher, not your crisis support"

### 5. Documentation
- Jamie documented patterns, not just incidents
- Helped identify that crises clustered around deadlines/connection-seeking
- Protected Jamie legally and emotionally

---

## Analysis: What the Patterns Revealed

### Pattern Recognition
**Morgan's crises happened:**
- Late at night (when lonely/unsupported)
- Before deadlines (when anxious)
- After positive interactions with Jamie (testing closeness)
- When experiencing rejection/abandonment elsewhere

**What this suggested:**
- Not manipulation—trauma response
- Crisis as bid for connection
- Limited external support network
- Difficulty self-soothing

**Appropriate response:**
- Boundaries + connection to actual resources
- Community access without teacher enmeshment
- Encouragement to build broader support

---

## Alternative Outcome: If Boundaries Weren't Held

### What Could Have Happened
If Jamie had:
- Responded to every late-night message with long supportive conversations
- Made constant exceptions for Morgan
- Taken responsibility for Morgan's crises

**Result:**
- Jamie burns out
- Morgan doesn't learn to use appropriate resources
- Other students feel neglected
- Pattern reinforces (crisis = connection with Jamie)
- Morgan doesn't build broader support network
- Relationship becomes enmeshed/trauma bond

---

## Lessons for Teachers

### 1. Crisis Dependency is a Pattern
- Look for: frequent crises, late-night contact, escalation when boundaries set
- Document to see patterns over time
- One crisis ≠ crisis dependency; weekly crises = pattern

### 2. Boundaries Help Students Build Independence
- Referring to 988 isn't abandonment—it's appropriate care
- Holding boundaries teaches: "You can handle this with right support"
- Flexibility within structure (not removal of all structure)

### 3. Trauma Explains, Doesn't Excuse
- Morgan's behavior made sense given their trauma
- AND Jamie still needed to maintain boundaries
- Both can be true

### 4. Admin Support is Essential
- Don't handle crisis dependency alone
- Escalate when boundaries aren't working
- Shared responsibility protects everyone

### 5. Some Students Need Less Structure, Not More
- Removing assignment pressure helped Morgan stay
- Community connection without performance pressure
- Met the student where they were

---

## Key Takeaways

**For recognizing crisis dependency:**
- Frequent crises (weekly or more)
- Late-night contact despite boundaries
- Escalation when support unavailable
- "You're the only one" language
- Crises cluster around connection/deadlines

**For responding:**
- Consistent boundaries (don't waiver for "real" crises)
- Refer to crisis resources EVERY TIME
- Document patterns
- Offer flexibility within structure
- Escalate when needed

**For prevention:**
- Set clear availability from day one
- Normalize crisis resources early
- Don't rescue—refer
- Build community, not one-on-one enmeshment

---

## Remember

Morgan wasn't a "bad" student. They were a traumatized person trying to survive while also trying to learn. **The boundaries Jamie held allowed Morgan to stay in the community while building appropriate support systems.**

> **Guiding principle:** You can care about a student's wellbeing AND maintain boundaries that protect both of you. Crisis dependency improves with consistent, boundaried care—not with rescue.
