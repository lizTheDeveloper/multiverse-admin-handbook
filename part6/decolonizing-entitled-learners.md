# Decolonizing Entitled Learners: A Scenario-Based Guide

## Overview

This guide addresses a specific challenge in liberatory education: what happens when students arrive with entitlement rooted in privilege (class, race, educational background, neurotypical socialization) and expect the learning space to center their needs, validate their perspectives, and operate according to hierarchies they're familiar with.

**This is decolonization work.** We're interrupting patterns of dominance, individualism, and extraction that students learned in colonial educational systems.

**Why this matters:**
- Entitlement undermines mutual aid (takes without giving)
- Entitlement reinforces hierarchy (contradicts horizontal relationships)
- Entitlement harms marginalized students (reproduces oppression in our space)
- Entitlement prevents the entitled person from learning (banking model stays intact)

**Liberatory Pedagogy Framework Applied:**
- **Freire**: Problem-posing challenges students to examine their assumptions, not depositing "correct" views
- **hooks**: Love includes confronting behavior that harms the collective
- **Goldman**: Mutual aid requires voluntary cooperation—entitlement is coercive
- **NVC**: Observations vs judgments; naming needs underneath entitled behavior
- **Indigenous frameworks**: Relational accountability—"how does your behavior affect all our relations?"

## How The Multiverse School Actually Operates

**Understanding this context is crucial for the scenarios below:**

We don't operate on an assignment/grading model. We practice problem-posing education and building community:

### Voluntary Participation, Not Compliance
- **No assignments with deadlines:** We offer exercises people can explore
- **No grades or completion tracking:** You build things or you don't
- **Natural consequences:** Don't do an exercise, don't get the learning from doing it
- **No compliance required:** You choose your own engagement level

### Recognition Through Contribution
- **Share what you build:** Post your projects/experiments in chat
- **Recognition comes from peers:** Community celebrates what you share
- **Broken things welcome:** Sharing something broken is contribution (we learn together by debugging)
- **Facilitators encourage sharing:** "Show us what you made!" not "Turn in your assignment"

### Building Community, Not Consuming Content
- **We build things together:** Not "complete coursework"
- **Mutual aid:** Share what you're learning, help others, investigate together
- **Co-learning:** Facilitators are experienced builders, not lecturers or graders
- **Horizontal relationships:** Everyone teaches and everyone learns (Freire)

**This means entitlement shows up differently:**
- Not "I deserve an extension" (there are no deadlines)
- Instead: "Give me the answer" (banking model demand) or "I'm too busy to share what I build" (extraction)

The scenarios below reflect this actual practice.

## What Is Entitled Behavior?

### Entitlement ≠ Neurodivergence

**Neurodivergent traits that can LOOK like entitlement:**
- Direct communication ("I need X") without social softening
- Not reading implicit hierarchies or social cues
- Persisting when told "no" because they don't understand the no was firm
- Asking "why?" because they genuinely need to understand the reasoning

**Actual entitlement:**
- Expecting accommodation without reciprocity
- Treating facilitators as service providers, not co-learners
- Demanding the community center their needs over collective wellbeing
- Using identity to avoid accountability ("You can't criticize me, I'm neurodivergent/trans/etc")
- Extracting knowledge/labor without contributing
- Expecting special treatment because of who they are or where they come from

**Key difference:** Neurodivergence is about *how* someone communicates. Entitlement is about *what* they believe they're owed.

---

## Common Entitlement Patterns

### Pattern 1: "I Paid, Therefore..."
**Mindset:** "I paid for this class, so you work for me"
**Shows up as:**
- Demanding immediate responses outside stated hours
- Expecting custom curriculum tailored to their interests
- Treating feedback as service failure

**Decolonizing response:** "You paid for access to a learning community, not a service. We're co-learners here."

---

### Pattern 2: "I Know Better"
**Mindset:** "I have a degree/job/credentials, so my perspective matters more"
**Shows up as:**
- Talking over less credentialed students
- Dismissing facilitator expertise
- "Well, actually..." in every discussion

**Decolonizing response:** "Everyone here teaches and everyone learns (Freire). Your experience is valuable AND so is everyone else's."

---

### Pattern 3: "My Needs Come First"
**Mindset:** "The community should accommodate me without me accommodating others"
**Shows up as:**
- Expecting the class schedule to revolve around their availability
- Requiring extensive emotional labor from facilitators
- Not considering impact on other students

**Decolonizing response:** "Mutual aid means we balance everyone's needs, not prioritize one person's."

---

### Pattern 4: "I'm Exempt from Boundaries"
**Mindset:** "Rules are for other people / I'm special"
**Shows up as:**
- Continuing behavior after being redirected
- Using charm, sob stories, or identity to bypass consequences
- "I didn't know" despite clear communication

**Decolonizing response:** "Our agreements apply to everyone. Can you participate voluntarily?"

---

### Pattern 5: "Critique Me = Oppression"
**Mindset:** "Any feedback is an attack on my identity"
**Shows up as:**
- "You're discriminating against me because I'm [identity]"
- Conflating behavioral boundaries with identity erasure
- Weaponizing social justice language to avoid accountability

**Decolonizing response:** "I'm naming specific behavior and its impact, not judging your identity."

---

## Scenario 1: The Credentialed Expert

### The Situation
You're facilitating a discussion on web accessibility. A student with a CS degree from Stanford keeps interrupting others:

> "Well, actually, that's not technically correct. In industry, we don't do it that way. I've worked at three FAANG companies and..."

They've said "well, actually" four times in 20 minutes. Two other students have stopped participating.

### Analysis Through Liberatory Lens

**What's happening:**
- **Banking model reassertion:** Student expects to deposit knowledge into "less informed" peers
- **Hierarchy creep:** Credential worship replaces horizontal learning
- **Extraction:** Taking airtime without leaving space for others

**Observation (NVC):** "You've prefaced four comments with 'well, actually' and referenced your industry experience each time. Two students who were participating earlier have stopped."

**Impact on collective:** Other students' knowledge is devalued; learning space becomes lecture hall.

### Liberatory Response Options

**Option A: Problem-Posing (Freire)**
> "[Student], I notice you've shared your industry experience several times. I appreciate that perspective. I'm curious: what have you learned from the other students in this discussion? What perspectives are new to you?"

**Why this works:**
- Shifts from banking model (them teaching) to dialogue (mutual learning)
- Doesn't shame their expertise, redirects how they use it
- Invites them to value others' knowledge

**Option B: Relational Accountability (Indigenous Framework)**
> "[Student], can we pause? Your industry experience is valuable. And I'm noticing that when you start with 'well, actually,' it positions others' contributions as incorrect rather than different. How do you think that affects the collective learning space?"

**Why this works:**
- Names the impact on "all our relations"
- Invites them to consider the web of connection
- Doesn't police language; explores effect

**Option C: Mutual Aid Reframe (Goldman)**
> "[Student], I want to interrupt a pattern. You have expertise from industry—that's a gift to share. Mutual aid means sharing it in a way that doesn't diminish others' knowledge. Can you try: 'In my experience...' or 'What I learned was...' instead of 'That's not correct'?"

**Why this works:**
- Honors their knowledge while naming the problem
- Offers specific alternative language
- Frames it as mutual aid (giving, not dominating)

**Follow-Up:**
If they continue:
> "I've asked you to share space. You're still dominating the conversation. We're going to pause your participation in this discussion and I'll talk with you after class."

**Private conversation:**
> "I see you have a lot to contribute. This space requires learning from everyone, not just teaching. Can you participate as a co-learner, or is this not the right space for you right now?"

---

## Scenario 2: "I Need You to Respond Right Now"

### The Situation
A student messages you at 9pm on Sunday:

> "I need help with this thing I'm building. I know you said you don't work weekends but this is urgent. I have a job interview Tuesday and I need to finish this project to show them. Can you just quickly look at my code?"

You've stated your hours (M-F, 9am-6pm) multiple times.

### Analysis Through Liberatory Lens

**What's happening:**
- **Individualism:** Student's timeline matters more than your boundaries
- **Extraction:** Demanding labor without regard for your capacity
- **Service model:** Treating you as available resource, not co-learner

**Observation (NVC):** "You've messaged me outside my stated hours (Sunday, 9pm) with a request framed as urgent based on your personal timeline."

**Underlying need:** Support, validation, success in job interview (legitimate). Immediacy (their responsibility to plan).

### Liberatory Response Options

**Option A: Boundary as Love (hooks)**
> "[Student], I don't respond to messages on weekends. My hours are Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm. I'll respond to this Monday morning.

> I care about your success, which is exactly why I hold this boundary—so I'm sustainable and available during my actual hours. Next time, please plan ahead so you're not counting on weekend responses."

**Why this works:**
- Doesn't engage with the urgency framing
- Names the boundary clearly
- Explains why (care, sustainability)
- Teaches planning

**Option B: Mutual Aid Reality Check (Goldman)**
> "[Student], mutual aid means we each give according to capacity and receive according to need. My capacity doesn't include weekend work. Your need for feedback is real, AND it's your responsibility to plan ahead.

> I'll respond Monday morning. For future: start projects earlier so weekend emergencies don't happen."

**Why this works:**
- Names mutual aid principles
- Holds them accountable for planning
- Doesn't rescue

**If They Push Back:**
> "I understand you're stressed about your interview. That doesn't change my availability. I'll respond Monday."

**Don't:**
- Justify your boundary
- Explain your weekend plans
- Feel guilty for holding limits
- Make an exception "just this once"

**Why:** Exceptions teach that boundaries are negotiable through pressure. Love means holding the line.

---

## Scenario 3: "I'm Too Busy to Contribute"

### The Situation
Your learning community is built on mutual aid: people share what they're building, help each other debug, answer questions, contribute resources. One student never shares anything:

> "I'd love to help but I'm just so busy with work. I barely have time to build my own stuff. I'm here to learn, not to teach."

They ask questions and expect others to help them, but never share what they're building or help others.

### Analysis Through Liberatory Lens

**What's happening:**
- **Extraction:** Taking from community without giving
- **Hierarchical assumption:** "Learning" = receiving; "teaching" = separate role
- **Individualism:** "I'm here for ME"

**Freire's insight:** "Whoever teaches learns in the act of teaching, and whoever learns teaches in the act of learning." Separation is the banking model.

### Liberatory Response Options

**Option A: Problem-Posing (Freire)**
> "[Student], I hear you're busy. I want to explore something with you: what's the difference between a class where you pay for instruction and a learning community based on mutual aid?

> In a mutual aid community, we learn THROUGH helping each other. When you help someone debug their code, you deepen your own understanding. You're not 'too busy to learn'—you're saying you're too busy for the method that creates learning here.

> Can you participate in this model, or would a different learning format work better for you?"

**Why this works:**
- Poses the problem: what kind of learning space is this?
- Doesn't argue; invites self-examination
- Names the incompatibility clearly
- Offers choice

**Option B: Mutual Aid Accountability (Goldman)**
> "[Student], mutual aid isn't charity—it's reciprocity. You've asked for help 8 times in the past two weeks. You've shared what you're building zero times. That's extraction, not mutual aid.

> I need to see you contribute to the community in the next two weeks. That could be:
> - Sharing something you built in chat (even if it's broken—that's learning!)
> - Answering someone's question when you know something
> - Sharing a resource or approach you tried
> - Helping someone debug their code

> Choose one. If you can't, this might not be the right community for you."

**Why this works:**
- Names the numbers (observation, not judgment)
- Explains mutual aid directly
- Gives concrete options
- Makes the consequence clear

**Option C: Love as Confrontation (hooks)**
> "[Student], I'm going to be direct because I care about you and this community. The way you're participating—taking without giving—harms everyone.

> It harms you: You're not actually learning as deeply as you would if you helped others.
> It harms others: They give to you while you withhold from them.
> It harms the community: Mutual aid breaks down when some people only take.

> I need you to start contributing. Not because I'm policing you, but because this is how we learn here. Are you willing?"

**Why this works:**
- Names harm (to them, others, collective)
- Speaks from care, not punishment
- Firm without shaming
- Invites choice

---

## Scenario 4: "You're Discriminating Against Me"

### The Situation
You've asked a student to stop monopolizing class discussions (they talk for 10+ minutes at a time, several times per class). They respond:

> "I can't believe you're silencing me. I'm autistic—this is how I communicate. This is ableism. I thought this was a neurodivergent-friendly space."

### Analysis Through Liberatory Lens

**What's happening:**
- **Identity shield:** Using neurodivergence to avoid behavioral accountability
- **Inversion:** Claiming oppression when facing boundaries
- **Harm to collective:** Other neurodivergent students lose access to speaking

**Complexity:** They might genuinely not realize the impact. AND the impact still matters.

### Liberatory Response Options

**Option A: NVC Clarity**
> "[Student], I hear that you feel silenced. Let me be specific about what I'm observing and what I'm requesting.

> **Observation:** In the last three classes, you've spoken for 10+ minutes at a time, multiple times per class. That's roughly 30-40 minutes out of our 90-minute class.

> **Impact:** Other students have less time to speak. Yesterday, three students didn't get to share at all.

> **What I'm NOT saying:** 'Be less autistic' or 'Don't contribute.'

> **What I AM saying:** 'Make space for others. Limit your comments to 3-5 minutes. Pause to let others speak.'

> This is about collective access, not about your neurodivergence. Can you work with this?"

**Why this works:**
- Observations, not evaluations (NVC)
- Specific numbers (not "too much")
- Clarifies what you're NOT asking
- Names collective access
- Invites cooperation

**Option B: Relational Accountability**
> "[Student], let's look at this through 'all my relations.' Your need to process verbally is real. AND three other students didn't get to speak yesterday because the time ran out.

> In a relational accountability framework, we ask: how does my action affect everyone? Right now, your speaking pattern affects others' ability to participate.

> Being neurodivergent doesn't exempt you from considering impact. What do you need in order to share space?"

**Why this works:**
- Indigenous framework: we're all interconnected
- Validates their need AND others' needs
- Distinguishes neurodivergence from entitlement
- Problem-posing: what do YOU need?

**Option C: Healing-Centered Confrontation**
> "[Student], I'm not pathologizing your autism. I'm naming a specific behavior (speaking for 10+ minutes repeatedly) and its impact (others can't participate).

> Neurodivergent-friendly doesn't mean 'no boundaries.' It means:
> - Clear expectations (I'm giving you those)
> - Explicit communication (I'm being explicit)
> - Accommodations for different ways of being (I can offer: written reflection space, async discussion option, 1-on-1 office hours)

> What I can't accommodate: One person taking most of the airtime. That harms the collective.

> What accommodation would help you participate while leaving space for others?"

**Why this works:**
- Defines neurodivergent-affirming space correctly
- Offers real accommodations
- Holds the line on collective wellbeing
- Problem-posing: what would help?

**If They Continue to Resist:**
> "[Student], I've explained the impact and offered accommodations. You're choosing to frame this as discrimination rather than accountability. I need you to decide: can you share space, or is this not the right community for you right now?"

**Document:** Record the entire exchange. Their claim of discrimination requires clear documentation.

---

## Scenario 5: "Just Tell Me How to Do It"

### The Situation
You've posted an exercise: "Build a simple to-do list app. Here are some resources to explore different approaches."

A student messages you:

> "Can you just tell me the best way to build this? I don't want to waste time trying different things. Just give me the solution so I can get it done."

Several other students have already shared their experiments in chat—some working, some not, all learning from each other.

### Analysis Through Liberatory Lens

**What's happening:**
- **Banking model demand:** "Deposit the answer into me"
- **Extraction:** Wants the result without doing the investigation
- **Individualism:** "Get it done" (product) over "explore and learn" (process)
- **Bypassing community:** Ignoring the learning happening in chat

**Why it matters:** You're building a community of people who investigate together, not a service that provides answers.

### Liberatory Response Options

**Option A: Problem-Posing (Freire)**
> "[Student], I notice you're asking for 'the solution.' I want to explore something with you: What do you think you'd learn if I just told you how to build it?

> Now consider: What might you learn by trying an approach, seeing what breaks, investigating why, and trying differently?

> The exercise isn't about producing a to-do app—you can download thousands of those. It's about investigating how different approaches work. That's the learning.

> What questions do you have about where to START investigating?"

**Why this works:**
- Poses the problem (what IS learning?)
- Invites investigation of their own assumption
- Doesn't shame; redirects
- Offers guidance on process, not product

**Option B: Mutual Aid Reframe (Goldman)**
> "[Student], look at the chat—five people have shared what they're building. Some are working, some aren't. They're learning from each other's experiments.

> That's mutual aid: we investigate together, share what we discover, help each other debug.

> If I just gave you 'the answer,' you'd miss that entire process. You'd also have nothing to contribute to the collective.

> Try something. Share it in chat—working or broken. See what questions emerge. That's how we build here."

**Why this works:**
- Points to the community already doing the work
- Names mutual aid correctly
- Reframes from product to process
- Invites them into the collective

**Option C: Banking Model Confrontation (Freire)**
> "[Student], what you're asking for is the banking model—I deposit knowledge, you receive it. That's not how we learn here.

> Problem-posing education means you investigate, experiment, discover. I facilitate—I can help you understand concepts, debug with you, suggest resources. But I don't do the investigation for you.

> That's not because I'm withholding—it's because receiving an answer doesn't create the learning. Building and breaking and rebuilding does.

> What do you want to try first?"

**Why this works:**
- Names the model explicitly
- Explains why you won't comply
- Offers what you WILL do
- Invites them to begin

**If They Push Back: "I'm paying for this class"**
> "You're paying for access to a learning community and facilitation. Not for me to do your learning for you.

> If you want someone to give you answers, there are tutorial sites that work that way. This community is different—we build the capacity to figure things out, together.

> Are you interested in that kind of learning?"

**Natural Consequence:**
They can choose:
- Try something and share it (get recognition, build skill, contribute to collective)
- Don't try (don't learn, don't get recognition, have nothing to share)

The consequence isn't punishment—it's built into the structure of learning itself.

## Scenario 6: The Tone Police

### The Situation
You're facilitating a discussion on accessibility. A disabled student says:

> "Abled people need to stop designing for themselves and start listening to us."

Another student responds:

> "Whoa, that's pretty harsh. I think if you said that more nicely, people would be more receptive. You catch more flies with honey, you know?"

### Analysis Through Liberatory Lens

**What's happening:**
- **Privilege protects itself:** Tone policing prioritizes comfort over truth
- **Respectability politics:** Marginalized people must be "nice" to be heard
- **Power inversion:** Person with privilege coaches person with oppression on communication

**This is a decolonizing moment:** Do you let privilege police marginalized voices, or do you interrupt?

### Liberatory Response Options

**Option A: Name the Dynamic (bell hooks)**
> "[Second student], I want to pause here. What you just did is called tone policing—asking someone to soften their message to make it more comfortable for the listener.

> [First student] was speaking from lived experience about ableism. Your response centered your comfort over their truth.

> In liberatory education spaces, we prioritize truth-telling over niceness. Disabled folks don't owe us pleasant delivery when they're naming harm.

> Let's return to what [first student] actually said: abled people design for themselves. What's your response to the CONTENT, not the tone?"

**Why this works:**
- Names the pattern (tone policing)
- Centers the marginalized voice
- Teaches the whole class
- Redirects to content

**Option B: Problem-Posing (Freire)**
> "[Second student], I'm curious about something. Who benefits when we ask marginalized people to make their critiques 'nicer'?

> Who decides what tone is acceptable?

> What happens to truth-telling when it has to be polite?"

**Why this works:**
- Doesn't lecture; asks questions
- Invites examination of power
- Lets them discover the dynamic

**Option C: Relational Accountability**
> "[Second student], let's think about 'all my relations' here. [First student] is disabled. They experience ableism directly. You're asking them to make their experience more comfortable for you to hear.

> How does that affect the learning relationship? How does it affect their willingness to speak truth in this space?"

**Why this works:**
- Invites consideration of impact
- Names the power dynamic
- Protects the marginalized speaker

**Follow-Up (to first student, privately):**
> "I want to acknowledge that you were sharing from lived experience and got tone-policed. That's exhausting. You don't owe anyone niceness when you're naming oppression. I've got your back in this space."

**Why this matters:** Marginalized students watch to see if you'll protect them or protect privilege.

---

## Scenario 7: "I Don't See Why This Is Necessary"

### The Situation
You've asked everyone to introduce themselves with name, pronouns, and one thing they're learning. A student says:

> "I don't really see why we have to do pronouns. Can't we just use people's names? This feels performative."

### Analysis Through Liberatory Lens

**What's happening:**
- **Resistance to inclusion:** Pronouns feel unnecessary to people whose pronouns are always assumed correctly
- **Privilege blindness:** Can't see why something they don't need matters
- **Undermining structure:** Challenging the facilitator's choice publicly

**Why it matters:** Trans/nonbinary students are watching to see if you enforce inclusive practices.

### Liberatory Response Options

**Option A: Clear Boundary**
> "[Student], we share pronouns because some people's pronouns aren't obvious, and we create inclusive space by not assuming. This is a baseline practice here—not optional.

> If you're not comfortable sharing yours, you can say 'ask me' or 'any pronouns.' But we're not debating whether to do it."

**Why this works:**
- Firm, no negotiation
- Explains briefly
- Offers alternative
- Protects trans students

**Option B: Reframe Through Mutual Aid (Goldman)**
> "[Student], in a mutual aid framework, we do things that benefit the collective even if they don't benefit us personally. You might not need to state your pronouns—people probably guess correctly.

> Other people in this space DO need that normalization. So we all do it, to make the space accessible for everyone.

> That's how mutual aid works: we all give so we all receive."

**Why this works:**
- Teaches mutual aid principle
- Names privilege without shame
- Collective over individual

**Option C: Love as Boundary (hooks)**
> "[Student], I care about you AND I care about trans and nonbinary people in this space. Sharing pronouns is how we create safety for them.

> Your discomfort is noted. We're still doing it. That's love for the collective."

**Why this works:**
- Both/and: care for them AND others
- Doesn't debate
- Names it as care

**If They Continue:**
> "[Student], this isn't up for debate. If you can't participate in this basic inclusion practice, this might not be the right space for you."

**Debrief (Privately, if needed):**
> "[Student], I'm noticing resistance to inclusion practices. I want to understand: What's behind that? Are you new to trans-inclusive spaces? Are you having a reaction to being asked to do something uncomfortable?

> I'm willing to talk about it. But the practice itself isn't negotiable."

---

## Teaching Decolonization: Meta-Moments

### When Students Say: "This Feels Like Oppression"

**What they might mean:**
- "I'm not used to being accountable"
- "I'm used to being centered"
- "My comfort usually matters most"
- "Structure feels constraining"

**Liberatory response:**
> "Let's distinguish between oppression and discomfort. Oppression is systemic deprivation of power, resources, and dignity based on identity.

> What you're experiencing is discomfort at not being centered. That's not oppression—that's decolonization. It feels unfamiliar because you're used to privilege.

> I'm asking you to stay with the discomfort and explore what it's teaching you."

---

### When Students Say: "I Thought This Was Supposed to Be Welcoming"

**What they might mean:**
- "Welcoming = I'm comfortable"
- "I expected to be catered to"

**Liberatory response:**
> "Welcoming doesn't mean 'you never feel uncomfortable.' It means 'you're invited to grow here.'

> In liberatory spaces, we practice fierce love—care AND accountability. Sometimes you'll be challenged. Sometimes you'll be called in. That IS welcome—it's trusting you can handle it."

---

### When Students Say: "Why Are You Making Everything About Race/Class/Power?"

**What they might mean:**
- "I don't usually have to think about this"
- "I want to just focus on the content"

**Liberatory response:**
> "Everything IS about race/class/power. Education has always been political. The 'neutral' classroom you're used to was actually centering dominant culture—you just didn't notice because it centered you.

> We're not 'making it political.' We're making the politics visible. That's decolonization."

---

## Reflection Questions for Facilitators

After an interaction with entitled behavior, ask yourself:

### 1. Observation (NVC): What exactly did I observe?
- Specific words, actions, patterns
- Not interpretations or assumptions

### 2. Whose Comfort Did I Prioritize?
- The entitled student's comfort?
- The collective's wellbeing?
- My own ease?

### 3. Did I Maintain Horizontal Relationships?
- Did I enforce from hierarchy ("because I said so")?
- Or explain from relational accountability ("how does this affect all of us")?

### 4. Did I Problem-Pose or Lecture?
- Did I tell them what to think?
- Or invite them to examine their assumptions?

### 5. Did I Separate Identity from Behavior?
- Did I criticize who they are?
- Or name specific actions and their impact?

### 6. Did I Offer Pathway to Repair?
- Did I just punish/remove?
- Or invite them to participate differently?

### 7. Did I Protect Marginalized Students?
- Did I center the privileged student's feelings?
- Or hold space for those harmed by entitlement?

### 8. What Did I Model for the Collective?
- That privilege gets accommodated?
- Or that entitlement gets interrupted with love?

---

## When to Pause, When to Remove

### Pause (Temporary):
- First or second instance of entitled behavior
- Student seems genuinely surprised by feedback
- Willing to reflect and adjust
- Pattern isn't harming marginalized students acutely

**Language:** "Let's pause your participation while you reflect on this. We'll reconnect in [timeframe] to discuss next steps."

### Remove (Permanent):
- Repeated entitlement after clear feedback
- Weaponizing identity to avoid accountability
- Harming marginalized students
- Unwilling to participate in mutual aid/horizontal relationships
- Can't accept that they're not the center

**Language:** "I've asked you to participate in mutual aid/relational accountability/horizontal learning. You're continuing to expect special treatment/dominance/extraction. This isn't the right space for you."

---

## Remember: This Is Love

**Decolonizing entitled learners IS loving them:**
- It invites them to unlearn supremacy (which harms them too)
- It offers them real relationships instead of hierarchies
- It trusts they can handle being decentered
- It protects the collective (including them)

**As bell hooks teaches:** "Love and critique can coexist." Confronting entitlement is an act of care—for the individual and the community.

**As Freire teaches:** "No one liberates themselves alone." We're offering them a chance to join the collective liberation. Sometimes they accept. Sometimes they don't. Both are information.
