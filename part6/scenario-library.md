# Scenario Library: What Would You Do?

## How to Use This Library

This is an interactive training tool for teachers and moderators. Each scenario presents a realistic situation you might encounter, followed by multiple response options and analysis.

**For self-study:** Read the scenario, choose your response before looking at the analysis, then compare.

**For team training:** Discuss scenarios in groups, debate the best response, then review the analysis together.

**Remember:** There's rarely one "perfect" answer. Context matters. These are guidelines, not rigid rules.

## Scenario 1: The Late-Night Crisis Message

### The Situation
It's 11:47pm on a Friday. You receive a DM from a student you've been working with for about 3 weeks:

> "I'm really struggling right now. I feel like everything is falling apart and I don't know what to do. Can we talk? I know it's late but I really need someone."

You've set clear boundaries about your availability (9am-6pm weekdays), which you stated in your intro and have mentioned in class.

### Your Options

**A.** Respond immediately with: "I'm here. What's going on?"

**B.** Respond immediately with crisis resources and a reminder about boundaries

**C.** Don't respond until the next morning, then provide crisis resources

**D.** Respond immediately: "I hope you're safe. Please call 988 (crisis line) right now. I'm not available after hours. I'll check in tomorrow during my office hours."

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Why this might feel right:** You care, they're in distress, it feels cruel not to respond
- **Why this is problematic:**
  - Reinforces that late-night messages get immediate responses
  - Sets a precedent you can't sustain
  - You're not equipped for crisis intervention
  - Your boundary becomes meaningless
  - Next week, they'll message at midnight again

**If you chose B:**
- **Why this is better:** You're responding to the crisis aspect without engaging in long conversation
- **Potential issue:** Still reinforcing late-night contact gets a response
- **When this works:** If it's truly the first time and you explicitly say "this is the only time I'm responding outside hours"

**If you chose C:**
- **Why this might be okay:** Holds your boundary firmly
- **Why this is risky:** If they're genuinely in crisis (suicidal, in danger), waiting until morning could be dangerous
- **When this works:** If the message doesn't indicate imminent danger

**If you chose D (BEST OPTION):**
- **Why this is best:**
  - Acknowledges their distress without taking responsibility for it
  - Provides appropriate resource (988 trained for this)
  - Holds your boundary
  - Shows you care while maintaining professional role
  - Clear about next steps (check in tomorrow during hours)
- **Follow-up:** Document the interaction, check in the next day, reinforce boundary if it happens again

## Scenario 2: The Public Trauma Share

### The Situation
In the middle of class discussion about a technical topic, a student posts in chat:

> "Sorry, I'm having trouble focusing today. I just found out my partner has been cheating on me for 6 months and I feel like my whole life is a lie. I don't know how to process this. Has anyone else been through something like this?"

Other students start responding with sympathy and their own relationship stories. The class discussion has completely derailed.

### Your Options

**A.** Let the conversation continue—community support is valuable

**B.** Immediately shut it down: "This isn't appropriate for class chat"

**C.** Acknowledge briefly, redirect, offer to connect privately

**D.** End class early so people can support the student

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Problem:** Class becomes group therapy, not learning space
- **Impact:** Other students who came to learn feel hijacked
- **Pattern:** Teaches that personal crisis = class attention
- **Time:** 45-minute class becomes trauma processing session

**If you chose B:**
- **Problem:** Too harsh, feels unsupportive, public shaming
- **Impact:** Student feels rejected, others feel unsafe sharing anything
- **Better if:** Phrased more gently

**If you chose C (BEST OPTION):**
> "I'm sorry you're going through that—breakups are really hard. That sounds like something to process with friends or a therapist rather than class chat. I'm here if you need resources.
>
> Everyone: let's get back to [today's topic]. [Student name], I'll check in with you after class."

- **Why this works:**
  - Validates their pain without taking on responsibility
  - Redirects class gently but firmly
  - Offers private follow-up
  - Models appropriate boundaries for other students
  - Protects the learning environment

**Follow-up actions:**
- DM student after class with therapy resources, support groups
- If they continue to share trauma in public channels, have a private conversation about boundaries

**If you chose D:**
- **Problem:** Reinforces that personal crisis halts collective learning
- **Impact:** Unfair to other students, unsustainable pattern

---

## Scenario 3: The Boundary-Testing Question

### The Situation
A student you've been working with for a month sends you a DM:

> "Hey! I know you mentioned you live in [City]. I'm going to be there next weekend visiting family. Want to grab coffee? It would be cool to meet in person!"

Your Options:

**A.** "Sure! I'd love to meet up. Here's my favorite coffee shop..."

**B.** "I don't meet with students outside of class context, but thanks for thinking of me!"

**C.** Ignore the message

**D.** "I appreciate the offer! I keep my teaching and personal life separate, so I don't meet students socially. But I'm glad you're enjoying the class!"

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Problem:** Blurs professional boundaries
- **Risk:** Other students notice preferential treatment
- **Consequences:** Sets precedent for personal relationships with students
- **Slippery slope:** What's next—friending them on social media? Going to their events?

**If you chose B:**
- **Better:** Clear boundary
- **Issue:** Slightly blunt, might feel cold
- **When this works:** If you've already set this boundary and they're testing it

**If you chose C:**
- **Problem:** Ambiguous—are you ignoring or haven't seen it?
- **Impact:** Student doesn't know if the boundary exists
- **Risk:** They might ask again

**If you chose D (BEST OPTION):**
- **Why this works:**
  - Clear boundary with kind tone
  - Explains the reason (not personal rejection)
  - Reaffirms value of their participation
  - Leaves no ambiguity
- **Alternative phrasing:** "I have a policy of not meeting students outside class context. Helps me stay sustainable and fair to everyone. But thanks for thinking of me!"

**Key principle:** Personal relationships with students (even friendly ones) create inequality and ethical complications.

---

## Scenario 4: The Accusation of Discrimination

### The Situation
You've asked a student to stop dominating every class discussion (they talk over others, interrupt frequently). You've redirected them gently twice, then more firmly the third time. They DM you:

> "I can't believe you're targeting me like this. I'm autistic and I have ADHD. This is ableism. You're silencing neurodivergent voices. I'm reporting this."

### Your Options

**A.** Apologize and remove all boundaries

**B.** Get defensive: "I'm neurodivergent too! This isn't about that."

**C.** Ignore the accusation and double down on consequences

**D.** Respond with empathy and facts

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Problem:** Teaches that accusations remove all accountability
- **Impact:** Other students continue to be talked over
- **Pattern:** Student learns this tactic works

**If you chose B:**
- **Problem:** Makes it about you, defensive posture
- **Impact:** Doesn't address the actual behavior
- **Miss:** Opportunity to clarify expectations

**If you chose C:**
- **Problem:** Doesn't acknowledge their perspective
- **Risk:** Escalates conflict, appears uncaring

**If you chose D (BEST OPTION):**
> "I hear that you feel targeted. That's not my intent. Let me be clear about what's happening:
>
> You've interrupted other speakers 6 times in the last two classes. When [Student A] was explaining their project, you cut them off twice. This impacts other students' ability to participate.
>
> I'm not asking you to be less autistic or less ADHD. I'm asking you to let others finish speaking. That's a baseline expectation for everyone in this space, regardless of neurotype.
>
> If you need accommodations around communication (more time to process, written prompts, etc.), I'm happy to discuss that. What's not negotiable is letting others speak uninterrupted."

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges their feelings without accepting the framing
- Provides specific, factual examples
- Clarifies what the boundary is actually about
- Distinguishes between neurodivergent communication and boundary violations
- Offers accommodations for actual needs
- Holds the line on behavior that affects others

**Documentation:** Record this conversation fully.

---

## Scenario 5: The Suspected Manic Episode

### The Situation
A student who's usually thoughtful and measured has, over the past week:
- Posted 47 messages in 3 days (average before: 5/week)
- Stayed up all night "working on the best idea ever"
- Started three new projects simultaneously
- Messaged you at 3am about "seeing the patterns in everything"
- Claimed they've "unlocked the secret to learning"
- Seems euphoric, irritable when questioned

### Your Options

**A.** Celebrate their enthusiasm and energy

**B.** Tell them you think they're manic and need help

**C.** Express concern, ask about their wellbeing, suggest professional check-in

**D.** Remove them from the community immediately

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Problem:** Possible mania is concerning, not celebratory
- **Risk:** They continue escalating, make dangerous decisions, crash hard
- **Miss:** Opportunity to connect them to help

**If you chose B:**
- **Problem:** You're not qualified to diagnose
- **Risk:** Defensive response, relationship damage
- **Issue:** Direct confrontation often doesn't work

**If you chose C (BEST OPTION):**
> "[Student], I've noticed some changes over the past week—a lot more activity, late-night messages, several new projects at once. I'm concerned about you. How are you doing? Are you sleeping okay?
>
> Sometimes when people are really energized and productive, it can be a sign that something's shifting. Have you talked to your doctor or therapist recently? It might be worth a check-in."

- **Why this works:**
  - Expresses concern without diagnosing
  - Names observable behaviors
  - Asks questions rather than making statements
  - Suggests appropriate resources
  - Maintains relationship

**If they dismiss your concern:**
> "Okay. I hope you're right. If you notice you're not sleeping or feeling really different, please reach out to someone. I'm here for class stuff, but a mental health provider can help with the rest."

**Then:** Document the conversation and behaviors you observed, monitor closely, and consider consulting with a peer educator or mental health professional if the pattern continues or escalates

**If you chose D:**
- **Problem:** Too extreme as first response
- **When this is appropriate:** If they're recruiting others into grandiose plans, making threats, or actively destabilizing the community

---

## Scenario 6: The Suicidal Statement

### The Situation
In general chat, a student posts:

> "I don't think I can do this anymore. What's the point of any of this? I'm just so tired."

### Your Options

**A.** Respond publicly: "Don't say that! You matter!"

**B.** DM them immediately: "Are you safe?"

**C.** Move to DM, assess safety, provide crisis resources, notify admin

**D.** Post crisis resources in the chat

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Problem:** Public response to crisis
- **Impact:** Makes them the center of attention (might reinforce)
- **Miss:** Doesn't actually assess safety
- **Risk:** Other students now worried, no real help provided

**If you chose B:**
- **Better:** Private is good
- **Issue:** Only part of what's needed

**If you chose C (BEST OPTION):**

**Public response (brief):**
> "I'm reaching out to you privately."

**DM:**
> "I saw your message. I'm concerned about you. Are you safe right now? Are you thinking about hurting yourself?
>
> If you're in crisis, please:
> - Call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
> - Text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
> - Go to your nearest ER if you're not safe"

**Then:**
- Document exact wording of their message (timestamp, screenshot if possible)
- If you have co-facilitators, inform them so they can provide backup support
- Follow up within 24 hours
- If they don't respond and you're genuinely concerned, consider reaching out to emergency contacts if you have them, or consult with a peer educator/therapist about next steps

**If you chose D:**
- **Issue:** Might be seen as dismissive
- **When this works:** Combined with DM

**Key principle:** Suicidal statements ALWAYS get private follow-up + crisis resources + documentation.

**Note for sole operators:** If you're running this alone, thorough documentation protects you and helps you track patterns. Consider having a peer advisor or therapist you can consult with (without sharing identifying details) when handling serious situations.

---

## Scenario 7: The Student Who Won't Leave You Alone

### The Situation
A student messages you constantly—not necessarily crises, just... everything. Questions about class, random thoughts, memes, "just saying hi," asking how your day was. It's become overwhelming. You've mentioned your office hours twice, but they don't seem to internalize it.

### Your Options

**A.** Just stop responding and hope they get the hint

**B.** Respond to everything—that's what caring teachers do

**C.** Have a direct conversation about communication boundaries

**D.** Have someone else tell them to back off

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Problem:** Passive, ambiguous
- **Impact:** They might not understand why you're "ignoring" them
- **Risk:** Hurt feelings without clarity

**If you chose B:**
- **Problem:** Unsustainable
- **Impact:** Your burnout
- **Pattern:** Teaches them this level of access is normal
- **Time:** Where does it end?

**If you chose C (BEST OPTION):**
> "[Student], I want to talk about our communication pattern. I've noticed you message me several times a day—sometimes about class, sometimes just to chat. I appreciate that you feel comfortable reaching out, and I want to be clear about what works for me.
>
> Here's what I can offer:
> - I respond to class-related questions during office hours (Tues/Thurs 2-4pm)
> - I check messages Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm, and respond within 48 hours
> - I don't engage in personal chat or check-ins outside of class context
>
> This isn't personal—this is how I stay sustainable and fair to all students. Does that make sense?"

**If they push back:**
> "I understand you'd like more contact. What I'm offering is what's realistic for me. If you need more support than that, here are some resources: [peer groups, therapy, crisis lines]."

**If you chose D:**
- **Problem:** Abdicates your responsibility to set your own boundaries
- **When to involve others:** If you've set clear boundaries repeatedly and they're being violated, a co-facilitator can provide backup or you might need to remove the student

---

## Scenario 8: The "You're the Only One Who Understands Me"

### The Situation
After a few weeks of class, a student DMs you:

> "I just want to say thank you. You're the first teacher who's ever really understood me. Everyone else in my life thinks I'm too much or too broken, but you see me. This class is the only thing keeping me going right now."

### First: Assess the Context

**Is this concerning?**

**NOT concerning (normal appreciation):**
- "You really get me, thanks"
- "I've never had a teacher understand neurodivergence like this"
- "This space feels different from other classes"
- Said once, no follow-up demands
- They have other supports/connections
- They're participating in community, not just focused on you

**Concerning (dependency forming):**
- "You're the ONLY thing keeping me going"
- "Everyone else has abandoned me but you won't, right?"
- Pattern of intense messages seeking reassurance
- No other supports mentioned
- Making you responsible for their wellbeing
- Escalating intensity over time

### Your Options

**A.** "I'm so glad! You're special to me too."

**B.** Ignore the message—it's too intense

**C.** Warm acknowledgment (if not concerning)

**D.** Acknowledge and redirect (if concerning pattern)

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Problem:** Reciprocates intensity and creates special relationship dynamic
- **Risk:** Beginning of trauma bond or enmeshment
- **When it's really problematic:** If there are other dependency signs

**If you chose B:**
- **Problem:** Dismissive, confusing
- **Miss:** Opportunity to either receive appreciation warmly OR set boundaries if needed

**If you chose C (BEST for normal appreciation):**
> "I really appreciate you saying that. It means a lot to know that this space feels affirming. That's exactly what we're trying to create here—where neurodivergent folks don't have to mask or explain themselves constantly. I'm glad you're here."

**Why this works:**
- Receives appreciation warmly
- Attributes it to the space/community, not just you personally
- Doesn't overcorrect or make them feel bad for expressing gratitude
- Normal human warmth

**If you chose D (BEST if dependency pattern emerging):**
> "Thank you for sharing that. I'm glad Multiverse feels supportive. I'm noticing the phrase 'the only thing keeping me going'—that's a lot of weight to put on one class. It sounds like you might need more support than this space can provide.
>
> Here are some resources for additional support: [therapy, peer support, crisis line].
>
> You're absolutely welcome here, and I also want you to have a full support network—not just one teacher or one community."

**Why this works:**
- Validates appreciation
- Names the concerning part specifically ("only thing keeping me going")
- Provides resources
- Maintains warmth while setting boundary
- Focuses on the pattern, not shaming the feeling

---

**The Key Distinction:**

"You really get me" = **Normal appreciation** → Receive warmly

"You're the only thing keeping me alive" + pattern of intensity = **Dependency forming** → Set boundaries

---

## Scenario 9: The Student Asks About Your Personal Life

### The Situation
During a casual moment in class, a student asks:

> "So, are you married? Do you have kids? Where did you go to school? What do you do for fun?"

Multiple students seem interested in your answer.

### Your Options

**A.** Answer fully—it builds connection

**B.** "I keep my personal life private, thanks"

**C.** Share selectively and redirect to class topic

**D.** Make a joke and don't answer

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Risk:** Opens door to more personal questions
- **Issue:** Shifts focus from learning to your life
- **Boundary:** Where's the line?

**If you chose B:**
- **Tone:** Can feel cold, shut-down
- **When this works:** If this is a repeated boundary violation

**If you chose C (BEST OPTION):**
> "I'm married, no kids, I went to [University] for [field]. For fun, I [hobby]. Okay, back to [class topic]—let's talk about [thing]."

OR

> "I tend to keep my personal life separate from teaching, but I'm happy to talk about [relevant professional info]. Now, back to [class topic]..."

**Why this works:**
- Brief, friendly, then redirects
- Sets precedent that you control what you share
- Doesn't shame them for asking
- Moves back to class

**If you chose D:**
- **Depends:** If it's playful and they're not offended, fine
- **Risk:** Ambiguity

**Key principle:** You decide what to share. Brief + redirect is usually safest.

---

## Scenario 10: Two Students in Conflict

### The Situation
Two students get into a heated argument in class chat:

**Student A:** "That's a really privileged perspective. Not everyone has access to [thing]."

**Student B:** "Are you calling me privileged? You don't know anything about my life. I've struggled plenty."

**Student A:** "I'm not calling YOU privileged, I'm saying the PERSPECTIVE is."

**Student B:** "Sure sounds like you're attacking me."

Other students are watching. The energy is tense.

### Your Options

**A.** Let them work it out

**B.** Take sides with whoever you agree with

**C.** Pause the conversation, move to private channels, mediate

**D.** Shut it down: "Stop arguing right now"

---

### Analysis

**If you chose A:**
- **Risk:** Escalates, other students uncomfortable
- **Pattern:** Class becomes conflict zone

**If you chose B:**
- **Problem:** Teachers shouldn't take sides in student conflicts
- **Impact:** Other student feels unsupported

**If you chose C (BEST OPTION):**

**Public message:**
> "I'm pausing this conversation. The topic is important, but the dynamic is getting heated. [Student A] and [Student B], I'm going to DM you both. Everyone else, let's give them space."

**DM to each:**
> "Hey, I see you both feel strongly about this. I think there's a misunderstanding happening. Would you be open to a brief mediated conversation with me and [other student] to clarify?"

**If they agree, facilitate:**
- Each person speaks without interruption
- Reflect back what you hear
- Focus on impact vs. intent
- Find common ground if possible
- Set expectations for future interactions

**If they don't agree:**
- That's okay
- Ask them to disengage in public channels
- Monitor for continued conflict

**If you chose D:**
- **Tone:** Authoritarian, doesn't address underlying issue
- **Miss:** Teaching moment about conflict resolution

---

## Using These Scenarios for Training

### For Individual Study:
1. Read scenario
2. Choose your response (before looking at analysis)
3. Read analysis
4. Reflect: What would you actually do? Why?

### For Team Discussion:
1. Present scenario (don't show options yet)
2. Each person shares their instinct
3. Discuss as group
4. Then review provided options and analysis
5. Identify: What principles guided the "best" response?

### For Role-Play:
1. Assign roles (teacher, student, observer)
2. Act out the scenario
3. Try different responses
4. Debrief: What felt effective? What was hard?

---

## Key Principles Across All Scenarios

1. **Boundaries protect everyone** — You, the student, the community
2. **Clarity over comfort** — Direct is kinder than vague
3. **Validate feelings, hold boundaries** — Both can be true
4. **Refer, don't rescue** — Connect to appropriate resources
5. **Document patterns** — Not single incidents
6. **Seek consultation when needed** — Peer educators, therapists, or advisors can provide perspective (even if you're the sole decision-maker)
7. **Consistency matters** — What you allow once, you'll see again

---

## Remember

**There's no script for every situation.** These scenarios provide frameworks, not formulas. Trust your gut, consult colleagues, document your choices, and prioritize safety—yours and the community's.

> **Guiding principle:** When in doubt, set the clearer boundary. You can always soften later, but it's harder to establish a boundary after you've been too loose.
