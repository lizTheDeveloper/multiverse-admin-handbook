# The Multiverse School: Teacher & Moderator Handbook

**A Guide to Supporting Neurodivergent Adult Learners with Care, Boundaries, and Safety**

---

## About This Handbook

Welcome to The Multiverse School's comprehensive guide for teachers, moderators, and administrators. This handbook exists to help you navigate the complex, rewarding work of supporting adult learners—many of whom are neurodivergent, healing from trauma, or experiencing mental health challenges.

As an adult education space, we attract brilliant, unconventional students. We also attract people who are struggling, seeking grounding, or still developing the skills they need for the responsibilities they seek. This handbook will help you honor different ways of being while maintaining the collective wellbeing of our learning community.

**Our approach is rooted in liberatory pedagogy**—drawing from Paulo Freire, bell hooks, Emma Goldman, and indigenous healing traditions. We practice problem-posing education, not the banking model. We build mutual aid, not hierarchy. We dare to love deeply—which includes setting fierce boundaries when needed. See our [Liberatory Pedagogy Framework](LIBERATORY_FRAMEWORK.md) for the theoretical grounding of this work.

## Who This Is For

- **New Facilitators** who need practical guidance on relational accountability and crisis response
- **Moderators** facilitating community spaces and navigating community challenges
- **Administrators** coordinating safety and co-creating policy with the community
- **The CEO/Founder** establishing institutional memory and ethical standards

## Core Principles

1. **Love as Political Practice (bell hooks)**
   - We dare to love deeply—which means caring enough to confront harm
   - Boundaries are acts of love that protect collective wellbeing
   - We honor each person's humanity while refusing to sacrifice community safety
   - "Love allows us to speak with care and to not be punitive, to be compassionate and empathetic"

2. **Relational Accountability Over Authority**
   - You are co-learners and facilitators, not managers or therapists
   - Power exists—we make it transparent and accountable, not invisible
   - Knowing your limits is not abandonment—it's honoring the relationships we can sustain
   - Everyone teaches and everyone learns (Paulo Freire)

3. **Early Recognition Supports Healing**
   - We pay attention to patterns that signal someone needs different support
   - Recognition is not pathologizing—it's asking "what healing do you need?"
   - Document with care, communicate with transparency, offer resources early
   - "All my relations"—one person's struggle affects the collective (Indigenous wisdom)

4. **Mutual Aid, Not Saviorism (Emma Goldman)**
   - We practice voluntary cooperation, not coercion or rescue
   - Vision paired with grounded preparation honors everyone's capacity
   - Leadership emerges through skill-building and relational accountability
   - We liberate ourselves together, or not at all (Paulo Freire)
