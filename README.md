## About This Handbook

This handbook helps facilitators navigate the complex, rewarding work of supporting adult learners—many of whom are neurodivergent, healing from trauma, or experiencing mental health challenges.

**Our approach:** We practice liberatory pedagogy, drawing from Paulo Freire, bell hooks, Emma Goldman, and indigenous healing traditions. We build mutual aid, not hierarchy. We dare to love deeply—which includes setting fierce boundaries when needed.

**Our commitments:** See [Facilitator Commitments](FACILITATOR_COMMITMENTS.md) for what we commit to in our practice.

**Our framework:** See [Liberatory Pedagogy Framework](LIBERATORY_FRAMEWORK.md) for the theoretical grounding.

**Who this is for:** New facilitators, moderators, administrators, and the founder—anyone supporting this learning community.

## Core Principles

**Love as Political Practice** — We care enough to confront harm. Boundaries protect collective wellbeing.

**Relational Accountability** — We're co-learners, not managers. Power exists; we make it transparent.

**Early Recognition Supports Healing** — We notice patterns and ask "what healing do you need?" not "what's wrong with you?"

**Mutual Aid, Not Saviorism** — We practice voluntary cooperation. We refer, we don't rescue.
