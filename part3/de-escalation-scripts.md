# De-escalation Scripts & Language

## Purpose

This guide provides specific language you can use in difficult situations. These scripts are:
- **Neurodivergent-affirming** — Clear, direct, no hidden meanings
- **Trauma-informed** — Grounding, not shaming
- **Evidence-based** — Drawn from crisis intervention and peer support research

**Remember:** Scripts are starting points, not rigid formulas. Adjust for context and your authentic voice.

## General Principles for De-escalation

### Do:
- **Stay calm** — Your tone sets the tone
- **Use short, clear sentences** — Especially important for neurodivergent people in crisis
- **Validate feelings** — "I hear that you're upset"
- **Separate person from behavior** — "That comment was hurtful" not "You're a hurtful person"
- **Offer choices when possible** — Restores sense of control
- **Name what you're doing** — "I'm going to pause this conversation for safety"

### Don't:
- **Argue with delusions or extreme emotions** — You won't win
- **Take it personally** — Their crisis is not about you
- **Make promises you can't keep** — "I'll fix this" or "Everything will be fine"
- **Use sarcasm or implied meaning** — Be literal and direct
- **Escalate your tone** — Match their volume or intensity

## Scenario 1: Student in Emotional Crisis

### Signs:
- Crying, panic, overwhelming distress
- Incoherent messages
- "Everything is falling apart"
- Not immediately dangerous but clearly struggling

### Script: Grounding Response

> "I can see you're going through something really hard right now. I want to help, but I'm not equipped for crisis support. Are you safe right now? Do you have someone with you?"

*[Wait for response]*

> "I'm going to share some crisis resources with people who are trained to help in these moments:
> - 988 Lifeline (call or text)
> - Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
>
> You don't have to handle this alone. Can you reach out to one of these right now?"

*[If they resist or say "I just need to talk"]*

> "I hear that you need connection. I care about your wellbeing, and that's exactly why I want you to talk to someone who can really support you through this. I'm your teacher, not a crisis counselor. Please reach out to one of those lines, and we can talk about class stuff when you're more grounded."

## Scenario 2: Boundary Violation (First Time)

### Signs:
- Late night messages
- Excessive DMs
- Overly personal questions
- Inappropriate tone or content

### Script: Clear Boundary Setting

> "[Name], I need to set a boundary. [Specific behavior] isn't sustainable for me. Here's what works instead: [Alternative]."

**Examples:**

> "I notice you've messaged me 10 times tonight. I can't respond to DMs after 8pm. Please post questions in the forum during daytime hours, and I'll respond within 48 hours."

> "That question is more personal than I'm comfortable answering. Let's keep our conversations focused on [class topic/learning goals]."

> "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but calling me 'your soul teacher' makes me uncomfortable. I'm here to facilitate learning, not to be a guru. Let's keep our relationship professional."

---

## Scenario 3: Boundary Violation (Repeated)

### Signs:
- You've already set a boundary once
- They're continuing the same behavior
- May be testing limits or unable to adjust

### Script: Boundary with Consequence

> "[Name], we talked about [specific boundary] on [date]. You've [specific repeated behavior] again. This is a problem."
>
> "Here's what needs to happen: [Clear expectation]. If this continues, [Clear consequence]."

**Examples:**

> "We discussed on Nov 5 that I don't respond to DMs after 8pm. You've messaged me late at night three more times this week. This needs to stop. From now on, I won't read late-night messages. If it continues, we'll need to pause your participation to reassess."

> "I asked you not to share personal trauma in the main channel. You did it again yesterday. I get that you're processing a lot, but this space isn't equipped for that. Please use the crisis resources I shared, and keep class discussions on topic. If this continues, you'll be muted."

---

## Scenario 4: Student Expressing Suicidal Ideation

### Signs:
- "I don't want to be here anymore"
- "What's the point of anything"
- Explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or death

### Script: Immediate Crisis Response

> "Thank you for telling me. I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. You deserve help right now."
>
> "This is beyond what I can support with, but there are people available 24/7 who can help you stay safe:
> - 988 Lifeline (call or text)
> - Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741
>
> Can you contact one of them right now? Or is there someone with you who can help you make that call?"

*[If they say "I'm not going to do anything, I just needed to vent"]*

> "I'm glad you're not in immediate danger. And also, talking about suicide is serious, so I still want you to connect with someone trained in crisis support. Please reach out to 988 or Crisis Text Line today."

*[After providing resources]*

> "I'm going to pause our interaction here so you can get the right kind of help. We'll check in after you've connected with support."

**Important:**
- Escalate to admin immediately
- Document everything
- Do not attempt to "talk them down" yourself
- Do not promise confidentiality in crisis situations

## Scenario 5: Delusional or Paranoid Behavior

### Signs:
- Claiming they're being hacked, stalked, or surveilled (without evidence)
- Believing they have special powers or divine mission
- Accusing others of conspiracies
- Psychotic symptoms

### Script: Don't Argue with Delusion

> "That sounds really stressful and scary. I can't verify what's happening, but it sounds like you could use someone to talk to about your safety."
>
> "Here are some resources with trained listeners:
> - 988 Lifeline
> - Crisis Text Line: 741741
>
> I also encourage you to talk to a doctor or therapist if you haven't recently."

**Don't say:**
- "That's not real"
- "You're being paranoid"
- "No one is targeting you"

**Do say:**
- "I hear that feels real to you"
- "I can't confirm that, but I want you to be safe"
- "Let's focus on getting you connected to support"

---

## Scenario 6: Aggressive or Threatening Behavior

### Signs:
- Insults, name-calling
- Threats toward you, other students, or themselves
- Hostile tone, all-caps, aggressive language

### Script: Pause and Contain

> "I'm pausing this conversation for safety. [Specific behavior] is not okay here."
>
> "We can revisit this when everyone can communicate respectfully. In the meantime, if you need support, here are resources: [crisis numbers]."

*[Then immediately:]*
- Mute or remove from channel
- Inform co-facilitators if applicable
- Document with screenshots

**If they threaten violence:**

> "I'm taking this seriously. I'm ending this interaction and notifying [admin/appropriate authorities]. If you're in crisis, please call 988 or go to your nearest emergency room."

---

## Scenario 7: Student Demanding Special Treatment

### Signs:
- "Why do they get [accommodation] but I don't?"
- "You're discriminating against me"
- "I need you to [unreasonable request]"
- Using identity or diagnosis to demand exceptions

### Script: Firm and Fair

> "I hear that you'd like [what they want]. Here's what I can do: [realistic option]. Here's what I can't do: [boundary], because [brief reason]."

**Examples:**

> "I understand you want me to review your work tonight. I can give feedback within 48 hours during business hours. I can't do same-day turnarounds for everyone—that's not sustainable."

> "I hear that you're frustrated. The community guideline about [X] applies to everyone, including you. If you need accommodations for [specific neurodivergent need], let's talk about what would actually help within our structure."

> "Calling this discrimination doesn't change the boundary. [Specific expectation] is required for everyone's safety and the integrity of the learning space."

---

## Scenario 8: Love-Bombing or Intensity

### Signs:
- "You're the only one who understands me"
- "You saved my life"
- Excessive gifts, praise, or declarations
- Rapid intimacy

### Script: Redirect Intensity

> "I appreciate that you value this space. I want to be clear that my role here is [teacher/facilitator], not [therapist/friend/family]."
>
> "If you're looking for deep connection or emotional support, I encourage you to build relationships with peers or seek community support outside of class. Here are some peer support resources: [links]."

**For excessive praise:**

> "Thank you—a simple 'thanks' is enough. You don't need to perform gratitude here."

---

## Scenario 9: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) Response

### Signs:
- Extreme emotional reaction to mild feedback
- Perceiving criticism where none was intended
- Spiraling after a boundary is set
- "You hate me" / "I'm terrible" / "I should just leave"

### Script: Reaffirm Care Without Removing Boundary

> "I can see that you're really upset. I want to be clear: this isn't rejection. I care about your wellbeing, and I also need to maintain [specific boundary]."
>
> "Feedback on [work/behavior] is not feedback on you as a person. You're valued here. And also, [specific expectation] still stands."

*[Give them space]*

> "Take some time if you need it. When you're ready, we can talk about how to move forward."

**Don't:**
- Remove the boundary to soothe their feelings
- Over-apologize ("I'm so sorry I upset you!")
- Argue about whether they should feel hurt

**Do:**
- Stay grounded
- Separate behavior from identity
- Reaffirm care while holding boundary

### Signs:
- "I want to start a school/community/movement"
- Recruiting within Multiverse
- Hasn't done groundwork
- Bypassing structure

### Script: Redirect to 90-Day Pause

> "I can see you have big ideas and a lot of passion. That's great. We also have a process to support people who want to lead or build: the 90-Day Visionary Incubation Track."
>
> "It's designed to help ground your vision and make sure it's safe and sustainable. You can't recruit or launch under the Multiverse umbrella until you complete it."
>
> "This isn't rejection—it's containment for safety. Vision without grounding is fantasy. We care about what you build."

*[If they resist]*

> "I understand you're eager to move forward. The pause is non-negotiable. If you choose to launch without completing the process, you won't be affiliated with Multiverse and we can't support you."

## Quick Reference: Tone & Body Language (for in-person or video)

- **Voice:** Calm, steady, slightly slower than usual
- **Volume:** Match or go slightly quieter than theirs (don't yell back)
- **Posture:** Open, non-threatening (uncross arms, face them)
- **Eye contact:** Offer, but don't demand (especially with autistic people)
- **Space:** Give physical distance if possible
- **Breathing:** Model slow, deep breaths

## After De-escalation: Self-Care

De-escalating crises is exhausting. After any intense interaction:
1. **Debrief with another staff member** — Process what happened
2. **Document** — Write it down while it's fresh
3. **Take a break** — 15 minutes minimum before next task
4. **Check your body** — Drink water, stretch, breathe
5. **Release responsibility** — You did what you could; the outcome isn't all on you

**From peer support research:** Providers need support too. Don't carry this alone.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity over comfort** — Be direct, not vague
2. **Validate feelings, hold boundaries** — Both can be true
3. **You're a bridge, not a clinician** — Redirect to appropriate help
4. **Document and escalate** — You're not alone in this
5. **Boundaries are care** — For you, the student, and the community

---

**Remember:** The best de-escalation is prevention. Clear expectations, early boundaries, and neurodivergent-affirming communication reduce most crises.
