# Documentation Best Practices

## Why Documentation Matters

Documentation serves multiple purposes:
1. **Pattern recognition** — One incident might be a fluke; three is a pattern
2. **Institutional memory** — Staff turnover means knowledge can be lost
3. **Legal protection** — If you need to remove someone or defend a decision
4. **Accountability** — For both students and staff
5. **Learning** — What worked? What didn't?

**From transformative justice:** Documentation isn't about punishment—it's about learning, preventing harm, and supporting accountability processes.

## What to Document

### Always Document:
- **Safety incidents** — Threats, self-harm mentions, violence, dangerous behavior
- **Repeated boundary violations** — After you've set a boundary once, track if it continues
- **Escalations to admin** — What happened, what you did, who you notified
- **Student removals or pauses** — Clear record of why and when
- **Concerning patterns** — Even if no single incident is serious

### Sometimes Document:
- **One-time awkward interactions** — If it's genuinely odd, make a brief note
- **Positive resolutions** — When a student responds well to feedback
- **Resource referrals** — What you offered and how they responded

### Don't Document:
- **Normal neurodivergent behavior** — Info-dumping, direct communication, enthusiasm
- **Identity or diagnosis** — Unless directly relevant to safety
- **Personal judgments** — Focus on observable behavior, not your interpretation
- **Gossip or speculation** — Facts only

## Documentation Template

### Incident Report Format

```
**Date & Time:** [Specific date and time]
**Student Name/Username:** [Name or identifier]
**Location/Platform:** [Discord, class session, email, etc.]
**Witnesses/Other People Involved:** [Names if applicable]

**What Happened:**
[Factual description of the event. Use quotes when possible.]

**What I Said/Did:**
[Exact language you used, actions you took]

**Student Response:**
[How they reacted]

**Immediate Outcome:**
[What happened right after]

**Follow-Up Actions:**
[Who was notified, what next steps were agreed on]

**Concerns/Observations:**
[Your professional assessment, patterns you notice]

**Resources Provided:**
[Crisis numbers, links, referrals]
```

### Example: Good Documentation

```
**Date & Time:** November 7, 2025, 11:30pm EST
**Student Name:** Alex Johnson
**Platform:** Discord DMs

**What Happened:**
Student sent 14 messages between 11:30pm and 12:15am, including:
- "I need to talk to someone right now"
- "Why aren't you responding, don't you care"
- "I thought this community was supposed to be supportive"
- "Never mind, I'll just handle it myself"

**What I Said/Did:**
At 8:00am the next morning, I replied:
"I see you reached out last night. I'm not available for DMs after 9pm. If you're in crisis, please use 988 Lifeline (call or text 988). For class questions, use the forum. I respond within 48 hours during business hours."

**Student Response:**
"Oh, I didn't know there was a time limit. I was just excited about an idea."

**Immediate Outcome:**
Student apologized and said they understood the boundary.

**Follow-Up Actions:**
- Added note to review community guidelines in next class session
- Watching to see if late-night messaging continues

**Concerns/Observations:**
This is the second time this month student has messaged late at night. Previous time (Oct 24) I didn't set explicit boundary. Will escalate if it happens again.

**Resources Provided:**
- 988 Lifeline number
- Crisis Text Line (741741)
- Link to community guidelines
```

### Example: Poor Documentation (Don't Do This)

```
Date: Some time last week?
Student: That guy with the weird energy

What Happened:
He was being super intense and creepy again. He always does this. I think he has BPD or something. He kept messaging me and I finally told him to stop.

What I Did:
Told him to chill out

Student Response:
Got defensive like he always does

Follow-up:
I'm done dealing with this guy
```

**Why this is bad:**
- No specific date or time
- Vague descriptions ("weird energy," "intense," "creepy")
- Includes armchair diagnosis (BPD)
- Doesn't include exact quotes or specific behaviors
- No actual documentation of what was said
- Personal frustration instead of professional observations
- No resources offered, no admin notified

## Neurodivergent-Affirming Documentation

### Focus on Behavior and Impact, Not Pathology

**Instead of:** "Student was manic and delusional"
**Say:** "Student reported not sleeping for 3 days, said they were 'chosen by the universe,' and attempted to recruit 5 people to live with them"

**Instead of:** "Student has narcissistic tendencies"
**Say:** "Student repeatedly interrupted others in discussion, dismissed peer input, and claimed to be 'the only one who really gets it'"

**Instead of:** "Student is unstable"
**Say:** "Student disclosed suicidal ideation, reported housing insecurity, and sent 20+ crisis messages in 4 hours"

### Distinguish Communication Style from Harm

**Autistic directness is not a problem:**
- "This class is boring" = Feedback (maybe blunt, but valid)
- "Your teaching sucks and you don't know what you're doing" = Disrespectful

**ADHD enthusiasm is not a problem:**
- Sending a long excited message about an idea = Info-dumping (communication style)
- Sending 40 messages in an hour demanding immediate responses = Boundary violation

**Document harm, not difference.**

## Privacy & Consent Considerations

### What Can You Share?
**Within Staff:**
- Safety concerns, boundary violations, and documented incidents (shared privately in staff-only channels)

**With Student:**
- Clear, factual summary of their behavior and why action was taken
- "On [date], you [specific behavior]. This violates [specific guideline]. As a result, [consequence]."

**Publicly:**
- Nothing specific without consent UNLESS there's imminent safety risk and you need to warn community
- Example: If someone is recruiting members to an unsafe living situation, you can say "X is not affiliated with Multiverse and we do not endorse their project"

### What You Can't Share:
- Student mental health disclosures (unless they pose safety risk)
- Diagnoses or medical information
- Private messages unless directly related to safety incident
- Personal details about their life outside the school

**Exception:** If there's imminent danger to self or others, you may need to breach confidentiality to keep people safe.

## Where to Store Documentation

### Secure, Centralized System
- Use shared staff folder (Google Drive, Notion, etc.) with limited access
- **Never** in public channels or personal notebooks that could be lost
- Label clearly: "Safety Incidents - Confidential"
- Organize by date and student name for easy reference

### What to Include in the System:
- Incident reports (using template above)
- Screenshots when relevant (especially threats, harassment, violations)
- Correspondence (emails, DMs where boundaries were set)
- Timeline of escalations

### Retention Policy:
- Keep safety incident reports indefinitely
- Minor behavioral notes can be deleted after 1 year if no pattern emerges
- If someone is removed from community, keep full documentation

---

## Using Documentation for Accountability

### Pattern Recognition
After 3 similar incidents, look for patterns:
- Time of day (late night messages = possible mania, substance use, or just different time zone)
- Triggers (feedback, transitions, being told "no")
- Responses to boundaries (do they adjust or escalate?)

### Informing Decisions
Documentation helps answer:
- "Is this student safe to stay in the community?"
- "Have we given them clear chances to adjust?"
- "What support have we already offered?"
- "Is there a medical or housing crisis contributing?"

### Communicating with Students
Use documentation when addressing patterns:
> "I want to talk about a pattern I've noticed. On [date], [date], and [date], you [specific behavior]. Each time I've [your response]. This is concerning because [impact]. Let's talk about what support you need to meet community expectations."

---

## Debriefing After Incidents

After any serious incident, schedule a brief staff debrief:
1. **What happened?** (Factual summary)
2. **What did we do well?** (Celebrate effective responses)
3. **What could we improve?** (No blame, just learning)
4. **What do we do next?** (Clear action plan)
5. **How is staff wellbeing?** (Check in on emotional impact)

**From transformative justice:** Reflection and learning prevent future harm.

---

## Legal Considerations

**Disclaimer:** This is educational guidance, not legal advice. Consult a lawyer for specific situations.

### When Documentation Protects You:
- If someone threatens legal action after being removed
- If someone makes false allegations
- If you need to defend why you didn't act sooner (you did, here's proof)
- If law enforcement is involved (threats, violence, etc.)

### When to Consult a Lawyer:
- Before removing someone who has threatened legal action
- If someone is threatening violence or making credible threats
- If you're unsure about confidentiality/privacy laws in your area
- Before sharing any info publicly that could be defamatory

## Key Principles

1. **Document facts, not feelings** — Behavior and impact, not judgments
2. **Specific and timely** — Write it down soon after it happens with details
3. **Secure and private** — Protect student privacy while maintaining institutional memory
4. **Use it for learning** — Patterns inform better policies and responses
5. **Neurodivergent-affirming** — Don't pathologize communication style; document harm
6. **Transformative justice** — Documentation supports accountability, not punishment

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before documenting, ask yourself:
- [ ] Is this about safety, boundaries, or a clear policy violation?
- [ ] Am I describing observable behavior (not diagnosing or judging)?
- [ ] Would this help another staff member understand the situation?
- [ ] Am I protecting privacy while maintaining necessary records?
- [ ] Have I included specific dates, quotes, and actions taken?

**Remember:** Good documentation protects everyone—students, staff, and the community. It's an act of care and responsibility.
