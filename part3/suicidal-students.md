# Responding to Suicidal Students

## Critical Context First

### You Are Not a Crisis Counselor

**Your role:**
- Recognize signs of suicidal ideation
- Take all mentions of suicide seriously
- Refer to appropriate crisis resources
- Document and escalate to admin
- Follow up with compassion

**NOT your role:**
- Provide suicide intervention therapy
- Conduct safety assessments
- Be their primary support during crisis
- Promise confidentiality you can't keep
- Take sole responsibility for keeping them alive

## When a Student Mentions Suicide

### Immediate Response Protocol

**If student expresses suicidal thoughts in any form:**

1. **Take it seriously** — Every mention matters
2. **Stay calm** — Your calm helps them feel safer
3. **Listen without judgment** — Don't minimize or dismiss
4. **Assess immediacy** — Are they in danger right now?
5. **Connect to crisis support** — 988 Lifeline, Crisis Text Line
6. **Document** — What they said, what you did
7. **Notify admin** — Same day, no exceptions

---

## Levels of Suicidal Risk

### Level 1: Passive Suicidal Ideation
**What it sounds like:**
- "Sometimes I wish I wasn't here"
- "I don't see the point anymore"
- "Everyone would be better off without me"
- "I'm so tired of this"

**What it means:**
- Thoughts about death without specific plan
- Emotional pain but not actively planning
- Still engaging with future (assignments, plans)

**Your response:**
> "I'm really glad you told me that. Those thoughts can be really scary and painful. Have you talked to a therapist or counselor about this?"

**Action:**
- Provide crisis resources (988, Crisis Text Line)
- Encourage connection to therapy
- Document and notify admin
- Check in regularly
- Don't ignore it, but don't panic

---

### Level 2: Active Suicidal Ideation (No Immediate Plan)
**What it sounds like:**
- "I've been thinking about how I would do it"
- "I don't know how much longer I can take this"
- "I think about suicide every day"
- Researching methods or writing goodbye messages

**What it means:**
- Actively thinking about suicide
- May have method in mind but no immediate plan
- Higher risk than passive ideation
- Needs professional intervention

**Your response:**
> "I'm taking what you're saying very seriously. I need you to call 988 right now, or I can stay on the line while you do. You need to talk to someone trained in crisis support. Can you do that?"

**Action:**
- Immediate referral to 988 (call or text)
- Stay with them (virtually or in person) until they connect
- Notify admin immediately
- Document thoroughly
- Follow up within 24 hours

---

### Level 3: Imminent Risk (Plan + Intent + Means)
**What it sounds like:**
- "I'm going to kill myself tonight"
- "I've got the pills and I'm going to take them"
- "I have a gun and I'm ready to use it"
- Specific plan, specific time, access to means

**What it means:**
- **EMERGENCY** — Immediate danger to life
- Requires immediate professional intervention
- This is a 911 situation

**Your response:**
> "I'm very concerned about your safety right now. I need you to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. If you won't do that, I need to call for help for you. You matter and I want you to be safe."

**Action:**
- Call 988 yourself and report the situation
- If they're with you (in person or video), call 911
- If you know their location, call emergency services to their location
- Notify admin immediately
- Stay on the line/in contact until help arrives
- Document everything

---

## Scripts for Common Situations

### Scenario 1: Student Mentions Suicidal Thoughts Casually

**Student:** "Ugh, I just want to die. This assignment is killing me."

**Teacher:**
> "I hear you're frustrated with the assignment. I also want to check—when you say 'I want to die,' are you talking about feeling overwhelmed, or are you actually having thoughts about ending your life?"

**If they say it's just a figure of speech:**
> "Okay, I hear you. Let's talk about the assignment. But if you ever do have those thoughts, please talk to me or call 988. I care about you and your safety."

**If they admit they're having real thoughts:**
> "Thank you for being honest with me. That takes courage. I'm not a therapist, but I want to make sure you get help. Have you called 988 or talked to a counselor? Can we look at those resources together?"

---

### Scenario 2: Student Discloses Suicidal Plan in Message

**Student messages at 2am:** "I can't do this anymore. I have a plan and I'm going to do it tonight."

**Your response (immediate, even though it's 2am):**
> "[Student name], I'm very worried about you. Please call 988 right now: you can call or text 988. If you won't do that, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. I'm also notifying [admin] so you have additional support. You matter and we want you to be safe."

**Then:**
1. Screenshot/document the message
2. Send to admin immediately (wake them up if necessary)
3. If you have emergency contact info for student, consider using it
4. Call 988 yourself to report and ask for guidance
5. Do NOT promise confidentiality
6. Do NOT try to handle this alone

---

### Scenario 3: Student Says "I'm Suicidal But Don't Call Anyone"

**Student:** "I need to talk to you about something but you can't tell anyone. I'm having thoughts about killing myself."

**Teacher:**
> "I'm really glad you're talking to me. I want to help. But I need to be clear: if you're in danger, I have to get you connected to people who can actually help keep you safe. I can't promise not to do that. Is that okay?"

**If they say no:**
> "I understand you're scared. But your safety is more important than keeping this secret. Here's what I can promise: I'll be honest with you about what I need to do. I care about you and I want you to get the right kind of help."

**Then provide crisis resources and notify admin.**

---

### Scenario 4: Student Survived Suicide Attempt, Now Returning

**Teacher (in private conversation):**
> "I'm glad you're back and that you're safe. I know that was a really difficult time. I'm here to support your learning, and I want to make sure you have the support you need outside of class too. Are you working with a therapist or counselor?"

**Listen to their response, then:**
> "That's good to hear. My role is to be your teacher and support your learning. For mental health support, [therapist/counselor/support system] is the right resource. I'm glad you have that. Let's talk about how to make this class work for you right now."

**Set expectations:**
- Clear boundaries about what you can/can't provide
- Flexibility with deadlines if needed
- Check-ins, but not therapy sessions
- Referral back to mental health support if crisis recurs

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't minimize:**
- "You don't really mean that"
- "You have so much to live for"
- "It's not that bad"
- "Just think positive"

❌ **Don't promise confidentiality:**
- "This stays between us" (You may need to break this)
- "I won't tell anyone" (You will tell admin and may call 988)

❌ **Don't debate:**
- "Suicide isn't the answer"
- "Think about your family"
- Arguing about reasons to live

❌ **Don't leave them alone:**
- If they're in immediate danger, stay with them until help arrives

❌ **Don't try to be their therapist:**
- You're not trained for suicide intervention
- Your role is to refer, not treat

❌ **Don't take sole responsibility:**
- You cannot keep someone alive through force of will
- This is a team effort: you, admin, crisis professionals, their support network

---

## After the Immediate Crisis

### Follow-Up Protocol

**Within 24 hours:**
- Check in with student (brief, caring message)
- Confirm they're connected to appropriate support
- Notify admin of outcome

**Ongoing:**
- Regular but boundaried check-ins
- Flexibility with academic expectations as appropriate
- Continued referral to crisis resources if ideation recurs
- Monitor for warning signs

**Template check-in message:**
> "Hi [student], I wanted to check in after our conversation yesterday. How are you doing? Are you connected with [therapist/988/support person]? I'm here to support your learning, and I want to make sure you're getting the right kind of help for what you're going through."

---

## Warning Signs to Watch For

### Behavioral Changes
- Withdrawal from class/community
- Giving away possessions
- Saying goodbyes
- Sudden improvement after deep depression (sometimes indicates decision made)
- Reckless behavior
- Increased substance use
- Sleep changes (insomnia or sleeping all the time)

### Communication Patterns
- Talking about being a burden
- Feeling trapped or in unbearable pain
- Talking about death or dying frequently
- Researching suicide methods

- "You won't have to deal with me much longer"

### Academic/Participation Changes
- Missing classes after consistent attendance
- Quality of work drops significantly
- Stops turning in assignments

## Are You Required to Report? (Probably Not, But...)

### Legal Reporting Requirements

**Important clarification for online adult education:**

You are **probably NOT a mandatory reporter** if:
- You teach adult students (not minors)
- You're not a licensed professional (therapist, doctor, social worker)
- You're not employed by a K-12 school or government agency
- You work for a private online education program

**Mandatory reporting typically applies to:**
- Teachers working with minors (K-12)
- Licensed mental health professionals
- Healthcare workers
- Social workers
- People working with vulnerable adults (elderly, disabled)

**The Multiverse School teaches adults.** Unless you're also a licensed professional in a different context, you likely have **no legal obligation** to report a student's suicidal ideation.

### Why You Should Still Respond Appropriately

**Even without legal mandates, you have ethical and practical reasons:**

1. **Duty of care** — You have a relationship with this person
2. **Liability protection** — If you knew and did nothing, that could be a problem
3. **Documentation** — Protects you if something happens
4. **Referral to resources** — You can help without overstepping

**Best practice:** Treat suicidal ideation seriously, refer to 988, document, and notify admin—not because you're legally required, but because it's the right thing to do and it protects everyone.

### What "No Mandatory Reporting" Means

**You don't have to:**
- Call police or 911 (unless the person explicitly requests it or you believe they're in immediate danger)
- Break confidentiality by telling family members
- Report to authorities

**You still should:**
- Take it seriously
- Provide crisis resources (988)
- Document what was said
- Notify admin
- Assess level of risk

### Transparency About What You Will Do

**At the start of working with students, communicate:**
> "I want you to feel comfortable talking to me. I also need you to know: if you tell me you're planning to harm yourself, I'm going to connect you to crisis support resources like 988. That's to help you, not to punish you. I'll also let [admin] know so we can support you as a team. I won't call police or your family without your consent unless I genuinely believe you're in immediate danger."

**This is clearer and more accurate for your context.**

### When You Might Call 911

**Only in true emergencies:**
- Person has means and plan and says they're doing it right now
- Person is in active danger (overdose in progress, etc.)
- Person explicitly asks you to call for help

**Otherwise:** Refer to 988 and let crisis professionals handle it.

### Check Your Specific State Laws

**This varies by state.** Some states may have broader definitions of who must report.

**To verify:**
- Google "[your state] mandatory reporter adult education"
- Consult with a lawyer if you're unsure
- Ask admin to clarify policy

**When in doubt:** Document and refer to 988. That's always appropriate.

## Supporting Yourself After a Student Crisis

### You Will Feel Things

**Common reactions:**
- Fear ("What if they actually do it?")
- Guilt ("Did I do enough? Should I have noticed sooner?")
- Helplessness ("I can't fix this")
- Grief (if student dies by suicide)
- Anger ("Why are they putting this on me?")
- Overwhelm ("I'm not trained for this")

**All of these are normal.**

---

### What Helps

1. **Debrief with admin or supervisor**
   - Process what happened
   - Get support
   - Ensure you followed protocol

2. **Remember your role**
   - You did your job by referring to crisis support
   - You cannot keep someone alive by yourself
   - Professional crisis counselors are trained for this

3. **Set boundaries**
   - You're a teacher, not a crisis counselor
   - It's okay to refer to 988 and step back
   - You can care AND maintain boundaries

4. **Seek your own support**
   - Therapist, supervisor, peer support
   - Don't carry this alone
   - Vicarious trauma is real

5. **Document thoroughly**
   - Protects you legally
   - Helps you remember what you did
   - Provides record for admin

---

## If a Student Dies by Suicide

### Immediate Response

1. **Confirm with admin before communicating**
   - Don't share news until verified
   - Coordinate response with admin/family

2. **Community notification (if appropriate)**
   - Brief, factual, compassionate
   - Provide crisis resources
   - Avoid glorifying or detailing method

3. **Support for other students**
   - Acknowledge grief
   - Normalize reactions
   - Provide crisis resources
   - Allow space to process

**Template:**
> "I have difficult news to share. [Student name] has died. We're heartbroken and grieving this loss. If you're struggling, please reach out to 988 or [school counselor]. We'll have [memorial/space to process] on [date]. Please take care of yourselves and each other."

---

### Postvention (After Suicide)

**For the community:**
- Memorial or tribute (coordinate with family)
- Grief support resources
- Normalize range of reactions
- Watch for contagion effect (other students at risk)

**For yourself:**
- Grief counseling
- Debrief with supervisor
- Remember: You did what you could
- You are not responsible for someone else's decision to end their life

**From research:** Suicide is complex and multifactorial. One person, one conversation, one class cannot prevent suicide if someone is determined. Your role is to be one part of a safety net, not the entire net.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Take all mentions seriously** — Even jokes or "casual" references
2. **Your role is to refer, not treat** — Connect to 988, don't be the crisis counselor
3. **You cannot keep someone alive alone** — This requires professional help
4. **Boundaries are essential** — For your wellbeing and theirs
5. **Document everything** — Protects everyone
6. **Notify admin always** — Don't handle this in isolation
7. **Support yourself** — This work is hard and affects you

---

## Quick Decision Tree

**Student mentions suicide:**
→ Take seriously, stay calm

**Assess risk:**
- **Passive thoughts** → Provide resources, document, notify admin, check in
- **Active ideation** → 988 referral, stay with them, notify admin immediately
- **Imminent plan** → 988 or 911, do not leave them alone, notify admin

**After crisis:**
→ Follow up, maintain boundaries, document, support yourself

## Remember

**You are not responsible for preventing every suicide.** You are responsible for:
- Taking it seriously
- Referring appropriately
- Documenting
- Notifying admin
- Following up with compassion

**That's enough. You're doing enough.**

> **Guiding principle:** Suicide prevention is a community effort involving crisis professionals, mental health providers, family, friends, and support networks. Your role is to be one caring, responsible link in that chain—not the entire chain. Refer with confidence, knowing that 988 crisis counselors are trained for exactly this situation.
