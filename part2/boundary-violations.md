# Boundary Violations & Love-Bombing

## Understanding Boundaries in Neurodivergent Spaces

Boundaries in neurodivergent communities require special consideration. Many neurodivergent people have experienced:
- Forced compliance with neurotypical social norms
- Rejection for "inappropriate" behavior that was actually communication differences
- Trauma from institutions and relationships that violated their autonomy
- Difficulty reading implied social cues

**Our approach:** Be explicit about boundaries, distinguish between communication differences and boundary violations, and use transformative justice rather than punishment.

## What Are Boundaries?

Boundaries are agreements about how we interact in shared spaces. They protect:
- Individual autonomy and consent
- Community safety and sustainability
- Teacher/staff wellbeing and capacity
- The learning environment's integrity

**Key principle from disability justice:** Boundaries are not about forcing neurotypical social performance. They're about consent, safety, and mutual respect.

## Communication Differences vs. Boundary Violations

### Communication Differences (Not Violations)
These are neurodivergent communication styles that may seem "inappropriate" but aren't harmful:

- **Direct/Blunt communication** — Autistic people often communicate directly without social softening
  - *Example:* "That explanation was confusing" instead of "I'm sorry, but I'm having a little trouble understanding..."
  - **Response:** Accept and appreciate directness; don't require neurotypical politeness

- **Literal interpretation** — Missing implied meanings or social hints
  - *Example:* Continuing a conversation when someone says "I should get going" (an implied goodbye)
  - **Response:** Be explicit: "I need to end this conversation now"

- **Info-dumping** — Sharing extensive information about special interests
  - *Example:* Long messages about a topic they're passionate about
  - **Response:** Set explicit limits: "I can read 2-3 paragraphs max. Can you summarize?"

- **Asking questions others find "too personal"**
  - *Example:* "How much money do you make?" or "Why don't you have kids?"
  - **Response:** "That's a personal question I don't answer. In this context, we focus on [topic]."

**How to respond:** Provide direct, explicit guidance without shame. Explain the boundary clearly: "Here at Multiverse, we [specific guideline]."

### Actual Boundary Violations
These behaviors cause harm regardless of neurotype:

- **Repeated unwanted contact after being asked to stop**
- **Sexual or romantic advances toward teachers/staff**
- **Excessive private messaging, especially late at night**
- **Sharing others' private information without consent**
- **Following or surveilling someone across platforms**
- **Threatening self-harm to manipulate responses**
- **Demanding immediate responses or constant availability**

**How to respond:** Name the behavior, state the impact, offer one opportunity to change, escalate if it continues.

## Love-Bombing: What It Looks Like

Love-bombing is intense, overwhelming expressions of affection, gratitude, or connection used to create rapid intimacy. It can be:
- **Intentional manipulation** (narcissistic or predatory behavior)
- **Trauma response** (attachment disorders, testing for rejection)
- **Neurodivergent social communication** (intense genuine feelings expressed without social filtering)

### Examples in Educational Contexts
- "You're the only teacher who's ever understood me"
- "This school saved my life, you're my real family"
- Excessive gifts, praise, or declarations of gratitude
- Rapid escalation to deep personal sharing within days
- Positioning teacher as savior, guru, or soulmate

---

## Why It's Problematic

Even when well-intentioned, love-bombing creates:
- **Unequal power dynamics** — Puts pressure on teachers to reciprocate or maintain special relationships
- **Boundary erosion** — Makes it harder to enforce professional distance
- **Community disruption** — Other students feel less valued or jealous
- **Setup for disappointment** — When teachers maintain boundaries, the person feels rejected and may spiral

**From transformative justice lens:** The harm isn't in the feeling—it's in how the intensity impacts others' autonomy and safety.

## Responding to Boundary Violations

### Step 1: Name It Directly (No Shame)
Use clear, non-judgmental language:

> "I notice you've sent me 12 messages tonight. Our community guideline is that teachers aren't available for DMs after 8pm. Please use the async discussion channel or wait until tomorrow."

> "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but calling me your 'soul teacher' makes me uncomfortable. I'm here to facilitate learning, not to be a guru or family member."

> "You've asked me three times to review your work today. I can respond once every 48 hours. Let's talk about what support structure would help you manage waiting."

---

### Step 2: Explain the Impact
Help them understand why the boundary exists:

> "When you message late at night repeatedly, it impacts my sleep and my ability to be present for all students. It also sets an expectation I can't meet."

> "Intense declarations of connection can feel like pressure to respond in kind, which isn't appropriate in a teacher-student relationship."

---

### Step 3: Offer Alternative
Whenever possible, redirect to appropriate channels:

> "If you need immediate support, here's the crisis line: [number]. For class questions, use the forum where everyone benefits from seeing the answer."

> "If you want to express appreciation, a simple 'thank you' is enough. You don't need to perform gratitude."

---

### Step 4: One Chance, Then Escalate
After one explicit boundary-setting:
- Document the conversation (date, what was said, what boundary was set)
- If the behavior continues, escalate to admin
- If it escalates (threats, stalking, manipulation), remove immediately

## Special Consideration: Attachment Trauma

Many neurodivergent people have experienced:
- Rejection and abandonment
- Inconsistent caregiving
- Institutional trauma
- Social isolation

**This context matters** — but it doesn't negate the need for boundaries.

**Transformative approach:**
- Acknowledge their pain: *"I hear that connection is really important to you, especially if you've been hurt before."*
- Hold the boundary: *"And also, I need to maintain a professional role here."*
- Redirect to appropriate support: *"I want to make sure you have people in your life who can offer the kind of relationship you're seeking. That's not me, but here are some peer support resources."*

## When Neurodivergent Communication Gets Misread

### Scenario 1: Autistic Literalism
**Student says:** "Can I message you whenever I have a question?"
**Teacher says:** "Sure, anytime!"
**Student:** Messages at 2am regularly

**What happened:** Teacher used social language ("anytime" = "during reasonable hours"). Student took it literally.

**How to fix:** Be explicit: "I can respond to messages sent between 9am-8pm on weekdays. I'll reply within 48 hours."

---

### Scenario 2: ADHD Hyperfocus
**Student:** Sends 10-message thread about an idea at 11pm

**What happened:** Got excited and hyperfocused, lost track of time and social norms

**How to fix:** "I see you're really excited about this! Please consolidate ideas into 1-2 messages and send during daytime hours. I'll respond within 2 days."

---

### Scenario 3: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)
**Teacher:** Sets a boundary
**Student:** Has intense emotional meltdown, feels rejected or attacked

**What happened:** RSD (common in ADHD) causes extreme emotional response to perceived criticism

**How to fix:**
- Stay calm and grounded
- Reaffirm care without removing boundary: *"I care about your wellbeing. This boundary isn't rejection—it's how I stay sustainable as a teacher."*
- Give space for feelings: *"I can see you're upset. Take some time, and we can talk when you're ready."*
- Don't remove the boundary to soothe their feelings

## Documentation Template

When boundary violations occur, document:

```
Date: [date]
Student name: [name]
Behavior: [specific description]
What I said: [exact language used to set boundary]
Student response: [how they responded]
Next steps: [what will happen if it continues]
Who was notified: [admin/lead teacher]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Be explicit, not implicit** — Neurodivergent people shouldn't have to guess your boundaries
2. **Distinguish communication style from violation** — Direct ≠ rude, info-dumping ≠ harassment
3. **Name impact, not intent** — Focus on what happened, not why
4. **One clear chance, then act** — Grace with accountability
5. **Transformative over punitive** — Address conditions and patterns, not just incidents

---

## Red Lines (Immediate Escalation)

- Threats of violence or self-harm as manipulation
- Sexual harassment or advances after being told no
- Stalking across multiple platforms
- Sharing private information to retaliate
- Recruiting others into their narrative against staff

**Response:** Immediate removal from community spaces, documentation, disaffiliation if necessary.
