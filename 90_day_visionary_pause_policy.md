**90-Day Visionary Pause Policy**

**Purpose:**
This policy exists to ensure that visionary ideas receive the incubation time necessary to mature into safe, grounded, and actionable community projects. It is designed for individuals who are inspired to launch new learning spaces, intentional communities, or transformational initiatives while affiliated with The Multiverse School.

---

### **Why a Pause?**
Big visions are powerful but potentially destabilizing—to others and to the visionary. Without time to reflect, test, and ground, visionary projects can:
- Harm participants due to lack of planning
- Become emotionally or financially exploitative
- Damage community trust and infrastructure

---

### **Who This Applies To:**
Anyone proposing to:
- Start a school, mutual aid hub, or communal living space
- Recruit others to a vision under the Multiverse umbrella
- Take on leadership before completing foundational skill-building

---

### **How It Works:**
1. **Mandatory 90-Day Pause:**
   - You are asked to **not launch**, **not recruit**, and **not claim affiliation** during this time.
   - Instead, engage in the **90-Day Visionary Incubation Track**.

2. **Reflection-Oriented Process:**
   - You will journal, test ideas at small scale, build foundational plans, and learn from mentors.
   - You are *not* being rejected. You are being protected—and so is everyone else.

3. **Evaluation Checkpoint:**
   - At the end of the 90 days, you may submit your work and request a review conversation with a Multiverse mentor.
   - Readiness is assessed based on follow-through, realism, and community safety.

---

### **What You May Not Do During the Pause:**
- Present your idea as a Multiverse-affiliated project
- Recruit members or volunteers within Multiverse spaces
- Attempt to secure funding or endorsement from Multiverse or its staff
- Take on vulnerable people (e.g. mentally ill, unhoused, minors) into your project without infrastructure

---

### **Consequences for Noncompliance:**
- You may be removed from chat spaces and classes
- Your name and project will be publicly disaffiliated
- You will not be eligible for future mentorship or collaboration

---

**Reminder:**
Building new worlds is sacred work. It must be done slowly, with care, and in full recognition of its risks. You are invited to earn your way into leadership by walking the full path.

> This is not a punishment. It is the path of integration.
