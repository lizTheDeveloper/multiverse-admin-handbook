## When in Doubt: Document and Consult

**Better to over-respond than to miss a crisis.**

**If you have co-facilitators:** Share the situation and make decisions together.

**If you're running solo:** Document thoroughly, and consider consulting with a peer educator, therapist, or advisor when you're uncertain (you can do this without sharing identifying details).

Support contacts: [Fill in your peer advisors, therapist, or other consultants]
