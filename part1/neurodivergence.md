# Neurodivergence in Adult Learning Spaces

## What is Neurodivergence?

Neurodivergence refers to natural variations in brain function and behavior. It includes (but is not limited to):
- ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)
- Autism Spectrum (ASD)
- Dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia
- Sensory processing differences
- Giftedness / twice-exceptionality (2e)

At The Multiverse School, neurodivergence is common, celebrated, and accommodated—but it is not an excuse for harmful behavior.

## Why Neurodivergent Students Seek Us Out

Traditional education often fails neurodivergent learners through:
- Rigid structure and pacing
- Social hierarchies and cliques
- Sensory-hostile environments (fluorescent lights, crowded rooms)
- Punitive approaches to "non-compliance"
- Lack of interest-driven learning

**We offer:**
- Self-paced, interest-led exploration
- Async and flexible formats
- Peer learning without hierarchical judgment
- Tolerance for unconventional thinking

This is why we attract so many brilliant, atypical minds. It's also why we must be intentional about boundaries.

## Common Neurodivergent Traits You'll Encounter

### ADHD Patterns
- **Hyperfocus then disappearance** — Students may binge-learn for weeks, then vanish
- **Rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD)** — Intense emotional reactions to perceived criticism
- **Time blindness** — Missed deadlines, late arrivals (not disrespect—executive function)
- **Interrupting or over-sharing** — Impulse control challenges in discussions

**How to support:**
- Use reminders and structured check-ins
- Give feedback gently and clearly
- Offer flexibility on deadlines when possible
- Redirect interruptions calmly, without shame

---

### Autistic Patterns
- **Direct communication** — May seem blunt or "rude" (usually not intentional)
- **Literal interpretation** — Sarcasm and implied meaning may be missed
- **Sensory sensitivities** — Light, sound, texture can be overwhelming
- **Special interests** — Deep dives into specific topics (can be a gift)
- **Routine and predictability** — Changes in schedule can be distressing

**How to support:**
- Be explicit and direct in your instructions
- Clarify jokes, metaphors, or indirect language
- Provide advance notice of changes
- Celebrate deep expertise, even if narrow
- Don't force eye contact or social performance

---

### Giftedness & Twice-Exceptionality (2e)
- **Asynchronous development** — Intellectually advanced, emotionally young
- **Perfectionism** — May avoid tasks they can't do flawlessly
- **Existential intensity** — Deep philosophical or moral distress
- **Underachievement** — Capability without follow-through

**How to support:**
- Normalize imperfection and iteration
- Provide intellectual challenge with emotional safety
- Help them break tasks into smaller steps
- Don't conflate intelligence with readiness

## When Neurodivergence Becomes a Concern

Neurodivergence itself is never the problem. The problem is when:
- **Boundaries are repeatedly violated** despite feedback
- **Other students feel unsafe** due to aggressive, obsessive, or intrusive behavior
- **The student refuses accountability**, citing their diagnosis as justification
- **Mental health instability** overlaps with neurodivergence in unsafe ways

### Example Scenarios

**Acceptable:**
- A student with ADHD forgets to submit an assignment → Remind them, offer extension

**Not Acceptable:**
- A student with ADHD sends 47 messages at 3am demanding immediate responses → Set boundaries, redirect to async channels

**Acceptable:**
- An autistic student asks clarifying questions about an assignment → Answer clearly and directly

**Not Acceptable:**
- An autistic student interrogates a peer's life choices in a public channel → Intervene, explain why it's inappropriate

## Accommodation vs. Enabling

### Accommodation
- Providing captions, transcripts, or visual aids
- Allowing async participation
- Giving clear, written instructions
- Offering flexible deadlines for documented needs
- Respecting communication preferences

### Enabling
- Excusing boundary violations because "they can't help it"
- Allowing one student to dominate all discussions
- Removing all structure because it's "too rigid"
- Accepting work that doesn't meet standards "out of kindness"
- Tolerating behavior that harms other students

**You are not required to tolerate harm in the name of inclusion.**

## Supporting Neurodivergent Students Ethically

1. **Presume competence**
   - Assume they can learn, grow, and meet expectations
   - Offer support, not pity

2. **Be explicit about norms**
   - Don't assume "common sense" is universal
   - State expectations clearly (e.g., "We don't DM teachers after 9pm")

3. **Provide structure with flexibility**
   - Frameworks help neurodivergent learners
   - But allow for variation within the framework

4. **Separate the person from the behavior**
   - "That comment was hurtful" not "You're a bad person"
   - Focus on impact, not intent

5. **Don't force neurotypical performance**
   - Eye contact, small talk, and "professionalism" are not moral requirements
   - Focus on learning and respect, not social conformity

---

## What You're Not Responsible For

- Diagnosing students
- Providing therapy or clinical support
- Excusing harmful behavior
- Being available 24/7 for emotional regulation
- Sacrificing the learning environment for one student

## Key Takeaway

Neurodivergence is a feature of our community, not a bug. You will teach more effectively if you:
- Learn the common patterns
- Communicate clearly and directly
- Accommodate differences without lowering standards
- Hold boundaries firmly and kindly

> **Remember:** The goal is not to "fix" neurodivergent students. The goal is to create a space where they can learn, contribute, and be held accountable like everyone else.
