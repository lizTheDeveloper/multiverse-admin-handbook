# If You're a Student Who Found This Handbook

Hi. This is the facilitator training manual for Multiverse.

If you stumbled on this, you might be feeling some things right now. Maybe curious. Maybe uncomfortable. Maybe recognizing yourself in some of these sections and wondering what we think of you.

---

## What This Is

This is a **training guide for facilitators** on how to:
- Hold healthy boundaries while building genuine friendships
- Recognize when someone needs more support than we can provide
- Navigate complex situations with care
- Protect both individual and community wellbeing
- Not burn out while doing emotionally demanding work

It includes pattern recognition guides, case studies (composites, not real people), and frameworks for hard decisions.

---

## What This Isn't

This is **not:**
- A secret file about you specifically
- A way to diagnose or label you
- Evidence that we think you're "broken" or "bad"
- Proof that the community isn't real or that friendships are fake
- A sign that you're being investigated or profiled

---

## Why It Might Feel Uncomfortable

**If you recognized yourself in a pattern description**, that can feel exposing. Clinical language about mental health patterns, crisis behavior, or boundary issues can sound cold when you're the subject of it.

**If you saw documentation practices**, it might feel like "they're keeping files on us."

**If you read the triage/removal sections**, it might feel like "they rank who deserves help."

All of that makes sense. This handbook is written in **facilitator language**—functional, pattern-focused, boundaried. It can sound clinical. That doesn't mean we see you clinically.

## What You Should Know

**Pattern recognition is not diagnosis.** We're facilitators, not therapists. We notice when someone might need support we can't provide, and we help connect them to resources.

**Documentation protects everyone.** It helps us remember what was said, coordinate between facilitators, track our own patterns, and make fair decisions. It's not gossip or secret files.

**Boundaries are care.** The frameworks in this handbook exist so we can show up sustainably for you. Without boundaries, we burn out and help no one.

**Friendships here are real.** The section about friendship isn't about keeping distance—it's about being both a good facilitator AND a good friend. We actually like you. We're actually friends. The complexity is in holding both roles.

**Removal is rare and sad.** It happens when someone's needs don't match what we can offer AND they're not accessing other support. It's about fit, not worthiness.

---

## If You're Hurt or Worried

**If something in this handbook hurt you**, let's talk about it. Seriously.

**If you recognize yourself in a concerning pattern section**, that doesn't mean you're doomed or unwelcome. It might mean:
- You could benefit from additional support (therapy, crisis resources, etc.) alongside being here
- We need to adjust how we're engaging
- There's a conversation to be had about what you need and what we can offer

**If you're worried we're secretly judging you**, we're really not. We're trying to do this work well while taking care of ourselves.

## The Thing About Transparency

We could have kept this handbook private. We're making it accessible because **transparency matters more than looking perfect.**

Yes, it means you can see the messy parts—the pattern recognition, the documentation practices, the triage thinking. That's vulnerable for us too.

The alternative would be facilitators with no training, no frameworks, making decisions based on vibes and burnout. This handbook exists because we care about doing this right.

---

## Bottom Line

**You belong here.** The existence of this handbook—with all its boundary-setting and pattern-recognizing—doesn't mean you don't belong.

It means we're trying to create a sustainable community where:
- People get the support they actually need (not just what we can fake)
- Facilitators don't burn out (so the community survives)
- Boundaries and warmth coexist (because they're not opposites)
- Hard decisions are made with frameworks, not impulse

**If you have questions or concerns about anything you read here, talk to us.** We'd rather have the awkward conversation than have you spiral alone.

---

**You're welcome here. This handbook exists to help us keep it that way.**
