**Moderator Guide: Handling Unstable or Dysregulated Students**

**Purpose:**
To give moderators and faculty a humane, safe, and clear protocol for responding when students display signs of emotional instability, delusion, or dangerous behavior—without stigmatizing mental health challenges or abdicating safety responsibilities.

### **I. Recognize Early Warning Signs**

**Emotional or Behavioral Indicators:**
- Extreme mood swings, incoherent or paranoid speech.
- Over-identification with the school, Liz, or staff (e.g., “you’re my real family,” “I’m chosen to lead this”).
- Attempts to recruit, control, or spiritually diagnose others.
- Boundary violations, excessive private messaging, or love-bombing faculty.
- Sudden aggression, threats, or erratic posting patterns.

**Environmental or Contextual Indicators:**
- Sleep deprivation, intoxication, visible disorganization, unsafe living conditions.
- Disclosure of violence, suicidal ideation, or hallucinations.
- Unverified claims of being stalked, hacked, targeted, or surveilled.

### **II. Immediate Steps (Containment Phase)**

1. **Stay Calm, Don’t Argue with Delusions**
   - Avoid confrontation or direct contradiction of delusional beliefs.
   - Use grounding statements like, *“I hear that’s scary. Let’s focus on what’s happening right now.”*

2. **Move to Private Chat (if safe)**
   - Reduce audience exposure and minimize contagion of panic.
   - Example: *“Hey, let’s move this to a private channel so we can support you properly.”*

3. **Assess for Safety:**
   - Ask neutrally: *“Are you safe right now?”* or *“Do you have someone there with you?”*
   - If there are threats of harm to self or others, **escalate to admin immediately**.

4. **Pause Their Access (Timeout)**
   - Temporarily mute, pause, or remove from chat spaces if behavior is disruptive or unsafe.
   - Document exactly what was said and what action you took.

### **III. Follow-Up (De-escalation Phase)**

1. **Tag In Admin or Faculty Lead**
   - Pass along all logs and notes.
   - Never manage ongoing crisis behavior alone.

2. **Establish Contact Boundaries**
   - Do not accept personal calls, texts, or emotional caretaking roles.
   - Redirect to: *“We want to make sure you have professional support. Here are crisis and community resources.”*

3. **Recommend Pause or Removal**
   - If the person remains destabilized, recommend a temporary or permanent break from participation.
   - Say: *“We want you to come back when you’re grounded and resourced. Right now, the environment isn’t safe for you or others.”*

4. **Use Care, Not Coddling**
   - Empathy without enabling. Example:
     > “You matter. But we’re not equipped for crisis care here. Please contact your local crisis line or therapist. We’ll be here when you’re stable again.”

### **IV. Documentation**

Always record:
- Date/time of incident.
- Exact quotes or screenshots if needed.
- Who was notified.
- Actions taken and any follow-up.

Keep documentation in a shared private staff folder marked **Safety Incidents**.

---

### **V. Post-Incident Reflection**

After removal or crisis resolution:
- Debrief with other moderators to check for emotional exhaustion or guilt.
- Review what warning signs were missed and update internal guidance.
- Decide collectively if the person can safely rejoin in the future.

**Golden Rule:**
> Compassion first, containment second, community always.
>
> We are educators, not crisis clinicians. Our role is to de-escalate, not to diagnose or rescue.
