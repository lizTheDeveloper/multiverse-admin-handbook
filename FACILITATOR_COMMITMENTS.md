# What We Commit To: Facilitator Standards of Practice

## Purpose

This document outlines what Multiverse facilitators commit to in our practice. These are the standards we hold ourselves to—not aspirational ideals, but actual commitments about how we show up.

**This is our accountability to students and to each other.**

---

## Core Commitments

### 1. We Commit to Transparency

**What this means in practice:**

- **We tell you our boundaries directly** — Not hints, not implications. If we need something from you, we say it clearly.

- **We explain decisions that affect you** — If we pause your participation or set a significant boundary, we tell you why. You won't be left guessing.

- **We're honest about our limitations** — We won't pretend we can offer support we can't provide. If something is beyond our capacity, we say so.

- **We acknowledge when we document** — We don't secretly track you. If we're noticing patterns that concern us, we'll name that.

- **We make our frameworks visible** — This handbook exists because we believe transparency about our practice is more important than looking perfect.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Endless justification of every boundary
- Debating our decisions indefinitely
- Explaining every internal facilitator conversation

---

### 2. We Commit to Boundaries With Care

**What this means in practice:**

- **We set boundaries before we're resentful** — We won't let things build until we snap. We'll address patterns early.

- **We separate behavior from person** — "This behavior doesn't work here" ≠ "You're a bad person."

- **We hold boundaries consistently** — Same rules for everyone. No special exceptions that create favoritism.

- **We explain boundaries in terms of impact, not judgment** — "When you message me at 2am repeatedly, I can't rest and show up sustainably for the community" not "You're being inappropriate."

- **We don't remove boundaries to de-escalate** — If setting a boundary causes distress, we acknowledge the distress AND keep the boundary.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Unlimited flexibility for individual circumstances
- Removing boundaries because they're uncomfortable
- Continuing to work with everyone regardless of fit

---

### 3. We Commit to Recognizing Our Limits

**What this means in practice:**

- **We refer, we don't rescue** — If you need therapy, crisis intervention, medical care, or case management, we connect you to those resources. We don't try to replace them.

- **We name when we're out of our depth** — If a situation exceeds our training or capacity, we say so and help you find appropriate support.

- **We protect our own sustainability** — We take breaks, set office hours, step back when we need to. Burned-out facilitators help no one.

- **We acknowledge when someone needs more than we can offer** — Not everyone is a good fit for what this space provides. That's not a moral failing—it's about matching needs to resources.

- **We don't claim expertise we don't have** — We're facilitators and educators. We're not therapists, case managers, medical professionals, or crisis responders.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Being available 24/7
- Solving all your problems
- Replacing professional support systems

---

### 4. We Commit to Documentation With Dignity

**What this means in practice:**

- **We document observable patterns, not character judgments** — "Messaged 15 times in 2 hours after I set a boundary" not "Student is manipulative."

- **We write as if you might read it someday** — Documentation should be fair even if uncomfortable. We don't write things we'd be ashamed to defend.

- **We use documentation to recognize patterns, not build cases against people** — The point is to notice when someone needs different support, not to collect ammunition.

- **We keep documentation private within the facilitation team** — We don't gossip or share outside of genuine safety needs.

- **We retain records only as long as needed** — Documentation isn't forever. We keep it while you're participating + a reasonable period after, then delete it.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Letting you read/edit all documentation on demand
- Never documenting concerning patterns
- Remembering everything without writing it down

---

### 5. We Commit to Friendship AND Facilitation

**What this means in practice:**

- **Our friendships are genuine** — When we say we care, we mean it. This isn't performance.

- **We're transparent about dual roles** — We'll name when we're speaking as a friend vs as a facilitator.

- **We enforce boundaries even with friends** — If someone we genuinely like violates community agreements, we still address it.

- **We don't use facilitator power for personal conflicts** — If we're annoyed at a friend, we handle it in friendship mode, not by wielding authority.

- **We model healthy friendship** — Distributed support, boundaries that protect relationships, repair after conflict, asking for what we need.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Equal closeness with everyone (some friendships naturally deepen more than others)
- Never making mistakes in navigating friendship + power
- Pretending we don't have personal preferences

---

### 6. We Commit to Pattern Recognition, Not Pathologizing

**What this means in practice:**

- **We observe patterns to understand needs, not to diagnose disorders** — "This person messages late at night frequently and doesn't use crisis resources" not "This person has BPD."

- **We use frameworks to guide responses, not to label people** — Mental health pattern guides help us recognize when to refer to professional support—they're not diagnostic tools.

- **We separate neurodivergent communication from harmful behavior** — Direct communication isn't rude. Info-dumping isn't harassment. We know the difference.

- **We ask "what healing might help?" not "what's wrong with this person?"** — Healing-centered practice frames patterns as unmet needs, not character flaws.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Ignoring patterns that indicate someone needs clinical support
- Pretending all behaviors are just neurodivergent communication
- Never using clinical language or frameworks

---

### 7. We Commit to Making Hard Decisions Thoughtfully

**What this means in practice:**

- **We consult when uncertain** — We don't make major decisions (like removing someone) in isolation. We seek input from co-facilitators or advisors.

- **We give clear warnings before removal** — You'll know if patterns are concerning. We won't suddenly remove you without having addressed the issues first (except in genuine safety emergencies).

- **We separate person from fit** — "You're not a good fit for this space right now" ≠ "You're a bad person."

- **We provide resources when we pause participation** — If we can't work with you, we help connect you to support that can.

- **We document our reasoning** — If we make a hard call, we can explain why based on observable patterns.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Never removing anyone
- Indefinite chances for repeated boundary violations
- Detailed explanations to satisfy all objections

---

### 8. We Commit to Mutual Aid With Limits

**What this means in practice:**

- **We assess fit, not worthiness** — Some people need support we can't provide. That doesn't mean they don't deserve help—it means they need different help.

- **We prioritize temporary crisis over chronic dependency** — We can bridge someone through a rough patch. We can't replace therapy or case management.

- **We distribute support across the community** — One person can't consume all facilitator capacity. We track this and adjust when needed.

- **We're honest about what mutual aid can and can't do** — Community support is powerful AND limited. We don't pretend otherwise.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Unlimited support for everyone
- Continuing mutual aid when it's enabling harm
- Being your only support system

---

### 9. We Commit to Continuous Learning

**What this means in practice:**

- **We acknowledge when we mess up** — We're human. We make mistakes. When we do, we own them and repair.

- **We adjust practices based on what we learn** — This handbook evolves. Our understanding deepens. We don't rigidly stick to approaches that aren't working.

- **We seek feedback** — If something we're doing isn't working, we want to know. We may not change everything, but we listen.

- **We debrief with each other** — We process hard situations, check our blind spots, and learn from collective wisdom.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Being perfect
- Changing everything based on every piece of feedback
- Never having learning edges

---

### 10. We Commit to Liberatory Pedagogy

**What this means in practice:**

- **We build horizontal relationships, not saviorism** — We're co-learners, not rescuers. We facilitate, we don't rule.

- **We believe you're the expert in your own experience** — We won't tell you what you need. We'll ask questions, offer frameworks, and support your self-determination.

- **We practice problem-posing, not banking** — We don't deposit knowledge into passive students. We create conditions for collective discovery.

- **We hold space for repair and accountability** — Conflict isn't failure. Harm happens. We create structures for addressing it.

- **We name and navigate power** — We have facilitator power. We don't pretend we don't. We make it visible and accountable.

**What we don't commit to:**
- Perfectly flat power dynamics (facilitation inherently involves some power)
- Never making unilateral decisions (sometimes we have to)
- Endless processing of every issue

---

## Accountability Mechanisms

**When we don't live up to these commitments:**

### You Can:
- **Name it directly** — Tell us when something doesn't match what we committed to

- Change our core practices to accommodate every request

## How We Hold Each Other Accountable

**Facilitators commit to:**
- **Peer feedback** — We call each other in when we're off track
- **Documentation review** — We check each other's reasoning
- **Debriefing hard situations** — We process together, not in isolation
- **Challenging each other** — If one of us is making a questionable call, we say so
- **Shared decision-making** — Major decisions aren't made alone

**We don't:**
- Trash-talk students to each other
- Make unilateral decisions we should consult on
- Ignore when a co-facilitator is burning out
- Let patterns slide because confrontation is uncomfortable

---

## Living Document

**These commitments evolve.**

As we learn, as the community grows, as we encounter new situations, we adjust our practice. This document will change over time.

**What won't change:**
- Transparency as a value
- Boundaries as care
- Referral over rescue
- Documentation with dignity
- Liberatory pedagogy as framework

**What might change:**
- Specific practices that aren't working
- How we handle particular situations
- The language we use to explain our work

---

## Remember

**These commitments exist because we care about doing this work well.**

We could operate on vibes and impulse. We could hide our decision-making. We could pretend we don't have limits.

Instead, we commit to:
- **Transparency** about our practice
- **Boundaries** that protect everyone
- **Honesty** about our capacity
- **Dignity** in all interactions
- **Accountability** to you and each other

**We're not perfect. We're committed.**

That's the standard.
