**Moderator Guide: Premature Transcendence & Cult Risk Management**

**What Is Premature Transcendence?**
When someone skips necessary healing, skill-building, or accountability work and tries to become a teacher, leader, or founder too soon. Often accompanied by:
- Grandiose visions
- Magical thinking
- Refusal to follow-through on basic tasks
- Recruitment of vulnerable people
- Bypassing feedback or structure

---

### **Warning Signs**
- Talking about building a school, commune, or movement with no actual groundwork
- Taking in vulnerable people (unhoused, mentally ill, etc.) without safety planning
- Forming “side projects” that aren’t clearly disaffiliated from Multiverse
- Disrupting classes or chat by positioning themselves as an authority
- Constantly seeking validation without contributing labor

---

### **What to Do**
**If someone shows early signs:**
- Gently redirect them to the 90-Day Visionary Incubation Track
- Privately clarify: “No recruitment or leadership roles until completion”
- Watch for whether they follow through or bypass

**If someone escalates (recruiting, causing harm, unsafe behavior):**
- Immediately remove from chat/class spaces
- Notify lead moderators or admin
- Publicly clarify disaffiliation if necessary

---

### **Language You Can Use**
- *“We require a 90-day pause to support grounding your vision.”*
- *“You can’t recruit or lead here until you’ve gone through the visionary track.”*
- *“This isn’t rejection—it’s containment for safety.”*
- *“This sounds like premature transcendence—we’ve seen it go badly before. Here’s what you can do instead.”*

---

### **Documentation**
Always log incidents that involve:
- Taking in high-needs individuals
- Unsafe living spaces
- Failed de-escalation
- Fire, threats, injuries, or police involvement

This helps establish patterns and protect the org.

---

**Core Principle:**
Contain the fire without shaming the spark. We protect the community *and* the visionary by insisting on readiness.
