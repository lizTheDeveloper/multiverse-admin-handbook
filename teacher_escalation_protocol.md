**Crisis Response Protocol: Dangerous or Destabilizing Behavior**

**Purpose:**
To guide facilitators through responding to crisis situations when a student becomes unstable, unsafe, or disruptive beyond normal capacity. This protects the individual, you as facilitator, and the community.

---

### **I. When Immediate Action Is Required**

You must take immediate action and potentially pause participation if any of the following occur:
- A student expresses intent to harm themselves or others
- There is threat of violence or actual harmful behavior
- A participant becomes delusional or psychotic and begins involving others
- You feel unsafe or manipulated
- The situation is beyond your training or emotional capacity

> **Rule:** If you feel unsafe or uncertain, trust your judgment and act. You don't need to be right—just proactive.

### **II. Step-by-Step Crisis Response**

**1. Ensure Immediate Safety**
- End the class or meeting if necessary: *"We're pausing this session to ensure everyone's safety."*
- Ask others to log off, leave the space, or disengage from the person in crisis.

**2. Document Immediately**
In a private log (create one if you don't have one):
- Time, date, event context
- Exact quotes or screenshots
- Actions you took
- Your assessment of the situation

**3. Provide Crisis Resources**
- Direct the person to 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or Crisis Text Line (741741)
- Do not attempt to "talk down" or provide therapy
- Use grounding phrases: *"I'm going to connect you with people who can help you right now."*
- Redirect to the [Crisis Resource Appendix](crisis_resource_appendix.md)

**4. Lock Down the Channel if Needed**
- Temporarily mute or remove the individual from the space
- Freeze the class chat or disable comments if necessary
- Protect the rest of the community from witnessing ongoing crisis

**5. Inform Co-Facilitators (If Applicable)**
If you have co-facilitators, notify them immediately:
- Name(s) involved
- What happened (brief summary)
- Current status (is anyone unsafe?)
- What action you took

### **III. Post-Crisis Procedure**

**Immediately After:**
- Take a break if you need it (even 10 minutes to breathe)
- Review your documentation while details are fresh
- Decide whether the person can return to the space

**Within 24 Hours:**
- Consult with a peer educator, therapist, or advisor if you're uncertain about next steps
- Contact the person directly (if safe) to assess their situation and communicate your decision
- Issue temporary or permanent removal if necessary
- Debrief with co-facilitators if you have them

**For Your Wellbeing:**
- Debrief with someone outside the community (therapist, friend, peer educator)
- Take time off from facilitating if the situation was intense
- Process your own reactions—this is hard work
- Don't carry this alone

---

### **IV. General Principles**
- **Boundaries Over Bravery:** You are not a therapist or rescuer.
- **Contain First, Care Second:** Stop harm before empathy; empathy follows.
- **Documentation Protects Everyone:** Write it down while it's fresh—protects you and helps you see patterns.
- **Consultation Is Strength:** You can make final decisions AND seek input from advisors.
- **Protect the Learning Space:** One crisis should not derail the whole community.

> **Mantra:** "We hold space, not emergencies."
