**Teacher Escalation Protocol: Crisis or Dangerous Behavior**

**Purpose:**
To guide teachers through the process of escalation when a student or participant becomes unstable, unsafe, or disruptive beyond normal moderation capacity. This protects the individual, the teacher, and the community.

---

### **I. When to Escalate Immediately**

You should escalate to admin or crisis response if any of the following occur:
- A student expresses intent to harm themselves or others.
- There is physical violence, arson, or destruction of property.
- A participant becomes delusional or psychotic and begins involving others.
- You feel unsafe or manipulated.
- The situation is beyond your training or emotional capacity.

> **Rule:** If you feel unsafe or uncertain, escalate. You don’t need to be right—just proactive.

### **II. Step-by-Step Escalation Process**

**1. Ensure Immediate Safety**
- End the class or meeting if necessary: *“We’re pausing this session to ensure everyone’s safety.”*
- Ask others to log off, leave the space, or disengage from the person in crisis.

**2. Notify Admin or Safety Lead**
Send a brief message via direct channel (or emergency text) with:
- Name(s) involved
- What happened (one-sentence summary)
- Current status (is anyone unsafe?)

**3. Document Quickly**
In a private moderator log or form:
- Time, date, event context
- Quotes or screenshots
- Actions you took

**4. Lock Down the Channel if Needed**
- Temporarily mute or remove the individual.
- Freeze the class chat or disable comments.

**5. Do *Not* Attempt Crisis Intervention Alone**
- Do not attempt to "talk down" or provide therapy.
- Use grounding phrases: *"We'll get you to someone who can help."*
- Redirect to the [Crisis Resource Appendix](crisis_resource_appendix.md).

### **III. Post-Escalation Procedure**

**Admin or Safety Lead Will:**
- Review your notes.
- Contact the person directly to assess safety and fit for return.
- Issue temporary or permanent removal if necessary.

**You Should:**
- Debrief with another staff member or lead moderator.
- Take 24 hours off from teaching if the situation was intense.
- Do not engage with the person privately unless asked by admin.

---

### **IV. General Principles**
- **Boundaries Over Bravery:** You are not a therapist or rescuer.
- **Contain First, Care Second:** Stop harm before empathy; empathy follows.
- **No Solo Heroics:** Always escalate up—never handle alone.
- **Protect the Learning Space:** One crisis should not derail ten learners.

> **Mantra:** “We hold space, not emergencies.”
