# Burnout Prevention & Recognition

## Two Types of Burnout

As educators, especially neurodivergent educators, you face risk of **two distinct but overlapping types** of burnout:

1. **Teacher Burnout** — Occupational burnout from the demands of teaching
2. **Autistic Burnout** — A distinct syndrome affecting autistic/neurodivergent people

**Both can occur simultaneously.** Understanding the difference helps you identify what you need.

## Part 1: Autistic Burnout

### What Is Autistic Burnout? (AASPIRE Research)

From **AASPIRE** (Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education):

> **Autistic burnout is "a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports."**

**Characterized by:**
- **Pervasive, long-term exhaustion** (typically 3+ months)
- **Loss of function** (skills you had become unavailable)
- **Reduced tolerance to stimulus** (sensory, emotional, cognitive)

**Key insight:** Autistic burnout results from cumulative stress of navigating a predominantly non-autistic world.

---

### The AASPIRE Autistic Burnout Measure (ABM)

In 2024-2025, AASPIRE validated the **Autistic Burnout Measure (ABM)**, developed through community-based participatory research with autistic people.

**The ABM assesses six facets:**

1. **Decreased cognitive abilities**
   - Trouble thinking clearly, processing information, problem-solving
   - "Brain fog" or "cotton wool brain"

2. **Decreased emotional regulation**
   - Emotions more intense, harder to manage
   - Meltdowns or shutdowns more frequent

3. **Increased sensitivity**
   - Sounds, lights, textures become overwhelming
   - Social interactions feel painful
   - Emotional hypersensitivity

4. **Decreased everyday abilities**
   - Skills regress: cooking, cleaning, self-care, communication
   - Things that were "easy" become impossible

5. **Increased avoidance or withdrawal**
   - Canceling plans, isolating, going nonverbal
   - Can't face people or tasks

6. **Increased exhaustion**
   - Bone-deep tiredness that sleep doesn't fix
   - "I can't keep going"

**Research finding:** The ABM effectively differentiates between autistic people currently experiencing burnout and those who are not (92% accuracy).

### Signs of Autistic Burnout in Educators

**You may be experiencing autistic burnout if:**

- **Masking becomes unbearable** — You can't force the "professional persona" anymore
- **Teaching skills regress** — Things you could do easily (planning, communication, organization) become impossible
- **Sensory sensitivity spikes** — The classroom/Zoom environment that was tolerable is now excruciating
- **Executive function collapses** — Can't plan lessons, respond to emails, keep track of tasks
- **Social interactions drain you completely** — Even brief student interactions feel overwhelming
- **Recovery time lengthens** — Used to bounce back after a class; now it takes days
- **Meltdowns or shutdowns increase** — Happening more frequently, less predictable
- **Loss of joy in teaching** — The work that once energized you now depletes you

**Critical distinction:** This isn't regular tiredness. This is **loss of skills and capacity** that were previously available.

### What Causes Autistic Burnout (Especially in Teaching)

**Primary causes from research:**
1. **Chronic life stress** — Ongoing demands without adequate support
2. **Mismatch of expectations and abilities** — Being expected to function neurotypically
3. **Lack of adequate supports** — Accommodations you need aren't in place

**In teaching specifically:**
- **Constant social performance** — Zoom calls, student interactions, meetings
- **Sensory overload** — Screens, notifications, voices, environments
- **Masking** — Suppressing stims, forcing eye contact, performing neurotypical communication
- **Cognitive demands** — Planning, multitasking, rapid decision-making
- **Emotional labor** — Managing students' crises while regulating your own emotions
- **Lack of autonomy** — Can't control pace, environment, or demands
- **Unpredictability** — Schedule changes, student crises, tech issues

---

### Recovery from Autistic Burnout (Evidence-Based)

**AASPIRE research suggests these recovery strategies:**

#### 1. Complete Rest
- Similar to post-exertional malaise: **rest is the primary recovery method**
- Not "take a weekend"—potentially weeks or months
- Permission to do NOTHING

#### 2. Reduced Cognitive Demands
- Stop multitasking
- Reduce decision-making
- Simplify your environment
- Say no to non-essential tasks

#### 3. Social Withdrawal (Intentional)
- This is protective, not problematic
- Reduce social obligations
- Cancel plans without guilt
- Go nonverbal when needed

#### 4. Empowerment and Control
- Reclaim autonomy where possible
- Set boundaries (even small ones)
- Choose your sensory environment
- Control your schedule

#### 5. Improved Self-Awareness
- Track your capacity (spoons, energy levels)
- Notice early warning signs
- Name what you need
- Stop before you collapse

#### 6. Energy Management
- Pace yourself (don't "push through")
- Build in recovery time
- Respect your limits
- Prioritize ruthlessly

**Key principle:** You can't "self-care" your way out of systemic inaccessibility. Recovery requires actual reduction of demands.

### Preventing Autistic Burnout

**From neurodivergent educator perspectives (2024 research):**

**What helps:**
- **Accommodations that actually work** — Not just "awareness," actual structural changes
- **Reduced masking** — Permission to stim, communicate authentically, take sensory breaks
- **Flexible schedules** — Control over when/how you work
- **Sensory-friendly workspace** — Noise-canceling headphones, lighting control, quiet spaces
- **Communication accommodations** — Async preferred, explicit instructions, written follow-up
- **Peer support** — Other neurodivergent educators who get it
- **Regular recovery time** — Built into schedule, not "if there's time"

**What doesn't help:**
- "Just practice self-care!" (toxic positivity)
- "Everyone gets tired" (minimizing)
- "Have you tried yoga?" (individual solutions to systemic problems)
- "You need to be more resilient" (ableism)

**Critical finding:** **Accommodations for yourself are not optional.** Autistic and ADHD teachers often advocate fiercely for students but don't request accommodations for themselves.

---

## Part 2: Teacher Burnout (General)

### What Is Teacher Burnout?

Occupational burnout specific to teaching, characterized by:
- **Emotional exhaustion** — Feeling drained, depleted
- **Depersonalization** — Cynicism, detachment from students
- **Reduced sense of accomplishment** — Feeling ineffective, helpless

**2024 statistics:**
- **78% of teachers** report feeling stressed
- **79%** experienced symptoms of poor mental health due to work
- Teacher burnout is at crisis levels

---

### The "Five Fires" Educators Face

From 2024 research on ADHD educators and burnout:

1. **Disillusionment** — The gap between ideals and reality
2. **Burnout** — Exhaustion from chronic stress
3. **Compassion Fatigue** — Reduced capacity to care after absorbing others' trauma
4. **Demoralization** — Feeling that good work is impossible in current conditions
5. **Moral Injury** — Forced to act against your values (e.g., harmful policies)

**ADHD/neurodivergent educators are especially vulnerable** because they:
- Feel deeply and show up big
- Care ferociously
- Keep pouring from an empty cup
- Blame themselves for systemic failures

---

### Signs of Teacher Burnout

**Physical:**
- Exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix
- Getting sick frequently
- Headaches, tension, body pain
- Insomnia or oversleeping

**Emotional:**
- Irritability, anger
- Anxiety, dread about work
- Feeling numb or detached
- Crying easily or inability to cry

**Cognitive:**
- Trouble concentrating
- Forgetfulness
- Difficulty making decisions
- Negative self-talk

**Behavioral:**
- Withdrawing from colleagues
- Procrastination
- Reduced quality of work
- Using substances to cope

**Relational:**
- Snapping at students or family
- Loss of empathy
- Avoiding social connection
- Resenting students' needs

---

### Preventing Teacher Burnout: Individual Strategies

#### 1. Set Realistic Expectations
- You cannot save everyone
- "Good enough" is good enough
- Your worth ≠ student outcomes

#### 2. Prioritize Actual Self-Care
**Not:**
- Bubble baths (though nice)
- "Treating yourself"
- Toxic positivity

**But:**
- Sleep
- Nutrition
- Movement you enjoy
- Saying no
- Therapy
- Boundaries (see Boundaries for Educators guide)

**From 2024 research:** Self-care is not self-improvement. It's "having a relationship with yourself grounded in gentleness, humor, and respect that includes strategies to soothe stress, set boundaries, and advocate for needs."

#### 3. Seek Support
- Peer support (other teachers)
- Therapy or counseling
- Supervision or mentoring
- Admin who actually support you

#### 4. Maintain Work-Life Balance
- Hard stop times (no work after X pm)
- Days completely off
- Hobbies unrelated to teaching
- Relationships outside of work

#### 5. Reduce Emotional Labor
- Not every student crisis is yours to solve
- Refer to appropriate resources (988, therapists, crisis services)
- Detach with compassion: "I care AND I'm not responsible for this"

### Preventing Burnout: Systemic Changes

**Individual strategies only go so far.** Burnout is often a systemic problem requiring organizational change.

**What The Multiverse School can do:**
- **Reasonable workloads** — Not 60-hour weeks
- **Actual support** — Not just "we care about self-care"
- **Flexibility** — Accommodations for neurodivergent teachers
- **Peer support structures** — Regular check-ins, debriefs
- **Clear policies** — So teachers aren't making impossible decisions alone
- **Shared responsibility** — Crises aren't handled by one person
- **Recognition** — Acknowledge the work, not just the problems

---

## Recognizing the Difference

### Is This Autistic Burnout or Teacher Burnout?

**Autistic Burnout:**
- Skills regress (things you could do, you can't now)
- Sensory sensitivity spikes
- Masking becomes impossible
- Social interaction feels painful
- Longer recovery needed (months, not days)

**Teacher Burnout:**
- Emotional exhaustion, cynicism
- Still can function, but don't want to
- Detachment from work
- Feels more psychological than physical
- Improves with time off (days/weeks)

**Both:**
- Can coexist
- Can worsen each other
- Require different interventions

---

## When to Step Back

### Yellow Flags (Consider Reducing Load)
- You're consistently exhausted, not just occasionally
- Students' needs feel burdensome, not energizing
- You're getting sick often
- You're snapping at people you care about
- Work is affecting sleep, eating, relationships

### Red Flags (Take Immediate Break)
- Suicidal ideation
- Meltdowns/shutdowns multiple times per week
- Skills have significantly regressed
- Physical health issues from stress
- Can't get out of bed
- Substance misuse to cope

**It is okay to step back.** Your wellbeing matters more than any class or project.

## Recovery Protocol

### Step 1: Assess
- Which type(s) of burnout am I experiencing?
- What are my most urgent needs?
- What support do I have access to?

### Step 2: Reduce Demands
- Cancel non-essentials
- Ask for accommodations
- Reduce teaching load if possible
- Take medical leave if needed

### Step 3: Rest (Really Rest)
- Not "productive rest" — actual rest
- Permission to do nothing
- No guilt

### Step 4: Rebuild Slowly
- Start with smallest possible tasks
- Increase gradually
- Watch for warning signs
- Adjust as needed

### Step 5: Implement Ongoing Prevention
- What needs to change long-term?
- What boundaries need to be in place?
- What accommodations do you need?

## Key Principles

1. **Autistic burnout ≠ Teacher burnout** — Different causes, different interventions
2. **Rest is not lazy** — It's the primary recovery method
3. **Individual strategies aren't enough** — Systemic change required
4. **Boundaries protect your capacity** — Not selfishness
5. **You can't pour from an empty cup** — Your wellbeing enables your teaching
6. **It's okay to step back** — Your health matters more than any class
7. **Recovery is possible** — With appropriate support and rest

---

## Remember

**You cannot teach sustainably while burning out.** Recognizing burnout early, taking it seriously, and implementing recovery strategies protects your ability to do this work long-term.

> **Guiding principle:** Self-care is not optional—it's essential infrastructure for sustainable teaching.
