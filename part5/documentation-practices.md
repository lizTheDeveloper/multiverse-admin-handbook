# Documentation Practices: Why We Keep Records

## The Purpose of Documentation

Facilitators document patterns, conversations, and decisions. This practice might feel clinical or surveillance-like, but it serves important functions for everyone involved—including the people being documented.

---

## Why We Document

### 1. For Individual Protection

**Documentation helps the person involved:**
- Provides accountability if there's ever a dispute about what was said or agreed to
- Ensures consistency between facilitators (everyone has the same information)
- Helps track patterns over time that might not be visible in isolated incidents
- Creates clarity about what resources were already provided
- Prevents repeating ineffective approaches

**Example:** If someone is in crisis multiple times and different facilitators keep offering the same resource they've already tried, documentation prevents that repetition.

### 2. For Community Protection

**Documentation helps protect the collective:**
- Tracks patterns of boundary violations or harmful behavior
- Enables accountability (you can't hold someone accountable without memory)
- Helps recognize when one person is consuming disproportionate resources
- Provides context for difficult decisions (like pausing someone's participation)

**Accountability requires memory.** Without documentation, patterns are invisible and decisions feel arbitrary.

### 3. For Facilitator Protection

**Documentation protects facilitators:**
- If ever questioned about a decision, there's a record of the reasoning
- Prevents burnout from trying to remember everything
- Allows facilitators to hand off situations without losing context
- Helps identify facilitators' own patterns (Am I being consistent? Fair?)

**Self-protection enables sustainable facilitation.** Facilitators who don't document burn out faster and make worse decisions.

### 4. For Institutional Learning

**Documentation improves practice over time:**
- Identifies patterns across multiple people (What common needs arise? Where are gaps in support?)
- Helps assess what interventions actually work
- Enables better training for future facilitators
- Creates institutional memory beyond individual facilitators

## What Gets Documented

### Observable Behaviors and Specific Events
- Exact quotes when relevant (especially for boundary violations or crisis statements)
- Dates and times
- What was said by both parties
- What resources were provided
- Decisions made and why

### Patterns Observed
- Frequency of crises
- Types of boundary violations
- Engagement patterns
- Whether someone is accessing recommended resources
- Changes over time (improvement, escalation, stability)

### What We DON'T Document
- Subjective judgments about someone's character ("they're manipulative")
- Gossip or speculation
- Information shared in confidence that doesn't relate to safety
- Personal opinions divorced from observable behavior

**The test:** Could another facilitator read this documentation and understand what happened without adding interpretation?

## How Documentation is Used

### To Make Informed Decisions
When deciding whether to:
- Continue working with someone
- Refer to additional resources
- Adjust boundaries
- Pause someone's participation

Documentation provides context beyond "this feels wrong" or "I'm exhausted." It shows patterns objectively.

### To Coordinate Between Facilitators
If multiple people are working with the same student:
- Everyone knows what's already been tried
- Consistency is possible (same boundaries, same messaging)
- One person burning out doesn't mean loss of all context

### To Review and Reflect
Facilitators can look back and ask:
- Am I treating people fairly?
- Are my boundaries consistent?
- What patterns am I noticing in myself?
- Is this approach working?

## What Documentation Is NOT

### Not Surveillance
**Surveillance implies:** Hidden monitoring, lack of consent, control

**Documentation is:** Transparent record-keeping about observable patterns in shared space

The difference: We're not watching your private life. We're noting patterns in how you engage in this community space and what support you've accessed.

### Not Pathologizing
**Pathologizing implies:** Labeling people as disordered, reducing them to a diagnosis

**Documentation is:** Observing specific behaviors and patterns

**Example of pathologizing:** "Student has BPD and is splitting"
**Example of documenting:** "Student messaged at 2am saying 'you hate me now' after I set a boundary about response times yesterday"

### Not Permanent Files
Documentation serves current need for safety and coordination. It's not a permanent record that follows someone forever.

**Retention:** Documentation is kept as long as someone is participating + a reasonable period after (for pattern recognition if they return). Then deleted.

### Not Gossip
Documentation is:
- **Private** — Shared only with facilitators who need the information
- **Functional** — For decision-making, not entertainment
- **Respectful** — Written as if the person might someday read it

**The test:** Would you be comfortable showing this documentation to the person it's about? (You don't have to, but you should be able to.)

## Transparency About Documentation

### What We Tell People

When someone joins Multiverse, they're informed:
- Facilitators may document concerning patterns for safety and coordination
- This information is shared among the facilitation team
- Documentation is used to make decisions about support and boundaries
- In genuine safety emergencies, information may be shared with crisis services

**We don't hide that we document.** Transparency about practice is part of liberatory pedagogy.

### When We Inform Someone Specifically

If documenting something significant, we may say:
> "I'm going to document this conversation so we both have clarity about what was said."

Or after a pattern emerges:
> "I want you to know I've been tracking this pattern because it's affecting your participation. Here's what I'm noticing: [specific observations]."

**Documentation isn't secret surveillance. It's transparent practice.**

## Ethical Guidelines for Documentation

### 1. Document Behavior, Not Essence
**Not:** "Student is needy and manipulative"
**Yes:** "Student messaged 15 times in 2 hours after I said I needed space. Messages alternated between apologizing and asking when I'll respond."

### 2. Include Context
**Not:** "Student had meltdown in chat"
**Yes:** "Student posted rapid messages expressing distress after another student criticized their work. Provided crisis resources, student logged off, followed up next day."

### 3. Be Specific
**Not:** "Student is always in crisis"
**Yes:** "Student has mentioned suicidal ideation 4 times in 6 weeks (dates: X, Y, Z). Each time, referred to 988. Pattern: crises occur when work deadlines approach."

### 4. Write with Dignity
**Test:** If this person read this documentation, would it feel fair? Not necessarily comfortable, but fair?

### 5. Document Your Own Actions
**Include:** What you said, what boundaries you set, what resources you provided, what you're uncertain about

This creates accountability for facilitators too.

## When Documentation Leads to Action

### Recognizing Patterns
Documentation makes patterns visible that might not be obvious in isolated incidents.

**Example:** Student has crisis every 2-3 weeks. In the moment, each crisis feels standalone. Documentation shows the pattern.

### Informing Decisions
When considering whether someone is a good fit for the space, documentation provides evidence beyond feeling:
- Are they accessing recommended resources?
- Are boundaries being respected?
- Is there movement toward stability?
- What have we already tried?

### Communicating with the Person
If patterns require conversation, documentation enables specific, fair feedback:

**Not:** "You're too much"
**Yes:** "I've noticed you've contacted me outside my stated hours 8 times this month (dates listed). My boundary about availability isn't working for you. Let's talk about whether this space is the right fit."

## Student Access to Documentation

**Current practice:** Documentation is internal to facilitators.

**If someone requests to see what's documented about them:** This is handled case-by-case. Generally:
- If it would help the person understand patterns and improve: Yes
- If it would be used to argue or manipulate: No
- If it contains information about other people: Redacted versions only

**Transparency doesn't mean unlimited access.** But documentation should be fair enough that you could defend it if questioned.

## Remember

**Documentation is not betrayal.** It's how we:
- Make fair decisions
- Track what actually works
- Protect everyone (including the person documented)
- Prevent burnout
- Maintain institutional memory

**Documentation with dignity honors both the need for records and the humanity of the people in them.**
