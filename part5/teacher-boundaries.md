# Boundaries for Educators

## Why Boundaries Matter

Teaching neurodivergent adults is rewarding, intense, and potentially all-consuming. Without clear boundaries, you will:
- Burn out
- Become resentful
- Enable unhealthy dependence
- Model unsustainable behavior for students
- Compromise the learning environment

**From research:** The wellbeing of neurodivergent students improves with clear structure and consistent boundaries. Your boundaries help them thrive.

---

## Core Boundary Principles

### 1. You Are a Teacher, Not a Therapist

**What this means:**
- You can offer empathy, not therapy
- You can listen once, then redirect to appropriate resources
- You can teach, not heal trauma
- You can refer, not rescue

**Examples:**

**Okay:**
- "That sounds really hard. Have you talked to a therapist about this?"
- "I can see you're struggling. Here are some mental health resources."

**Not Okay:**
- Processing their childhood trauma in hour-long calls
- Becoming their emotional support person
- Adjusting your entire teaching style around their triggers

---

### 2. Friendship IS Part of the Pedagogy (And How to Do It Well)

**The Multiverse ethos:** We ARE here to make friends. That's not a bug, it's a feature.

Many neurodivergent people have experienced social isolation, friendship trauma, or never learned healthy friendship skills. **Part of what we offer is a place to practice friendship in a supportive environment.** You, as a facilitator, are not separate from that—you're part of the community too.

**The question isn't "Should I be friends with students?" It's "How do I cultivate healthy friendships while maintaining the responsibilities of facilitation?"**

---

#### What Healthy Friendship in Learning Communities Looks Like

**Healthy friendship here means:**

✅ **Genuine care and connection**
- You actually like these people
- You enjoy their company
- You celebrate their wins
- You share interests and ideas
- You build reciprocal relationships over time

✅ **Distributed connection**
- Friendships develop naturally across the community
- No one person is your sole support
- You have friends outside of Multiverse too
- Students have support beyond just you

✅ **Transparency about roles**
- Everyone knows you're a facilitator AND a friend
- You're clear about when you're wearing which hat
- You name when you need to make a facilitation decision even if it's hard for a friend

✅ **Boundaries that protect the friendship**
- You don't use friends as your therapist
- They don't use you as theirs
- You maintain your own wellbeing so you can show up
- You can say no and the friendship survives

✅ **Community over individual**
- Your friendships don't create exclusive inner circles
- You facilitate fairly even when you have personal friendships
- You model healthy boundaries for the whole community

#### The Difference Between Friendship and Dependency

**Friendship:**
- Mutual—both people give and receive
- Distributed—you each have other supports
- Boundaried—you can say no and it's okay
- Sustainable—feels energizing, not draining
- Grows naturally over time
- Survives conflict and repair

**Dependency (what to avoid):**
- One-sided—one person needs, the other gives
- Concentrated—"you're the only one who gets me"
- Boundaryless—saying no creates crisis
- Draining—you're exhausted, resentful
- Demands intensity immediately
- Can't tolerate limits or feedback

**You can be friends with students. You cannot be enmeshed with them.**

---

#### Being a Good Teacher AND a Good Friend

**How to hold both roles:**

1. **Be explicit about which hat you're wearing**
   - "As your friend, I think you should do whatever feels right. As a facilitator, I need to let you know this violates our Code of Conduct."
   - "I'm speaking now as a friend, not as a teacher: I'm worried about you."

2. **Make facilitator decisions without apology**
   - If a friend violates boundaries, you still enforce them
   - If a friend needs to be removed, you can do that AND still care about them
   - "I care about you as a person AND this behavior doesn't work in this space"

3. **Don't use your facilitator power to manage personal feelings**
   - If you're annoyed with a friend, don't use facilitation authority to address it
   - Deal with friendship stuff in friendship mode
   - Deal with community stuff in facilitator mode
   - Don't conflate the two

4. **Model healthy friendship for the community**
   - Show what distributed support looks like
   - Demonstrate boundaries in action
   - Repair when you mess up
   - Ask for what you need

5. **Take friendship breaks when you need them**
   - If you're burned out, you can step back from some friendships temporarily
   - "I need some space right now for my own wellbeing. This isn't about you."
   - Friendships that survive breaks are real friendships

---

#### Practical Examples: Friendship + Facilitation

**Example 1: Your friend is struggling but not using resources**

As a friend:
> "Hey, I'm noticing you're really struggling. Have you been able to connect with your therapist? I'm worried about you."

As a facilitator:
> "I need to name that you've posted several crisis messages this week. The community pattern is to use 988 for crisis support. Can you commit to that?"

Both can be true. The friendship is real AND the boundary is necessary.

---

**Example 2: Your friend did something cool**

As a friend:
> "Dude, that project you built is SO COOL! I'm genuinely excited about this!"

(This is fine! Celebrate your friends! Just make sure you're celebrating others too when they do cool stuff. Friendship doesn't mean favoritism.)

---

**Example 3: Your friend wants to vent about another student**

As a friend:
> "I hear you're frustrated. And also, I can't get into a conversation about another student with you. That's a facilitation boundary I need to hold."

You can acknowledge their feelings AND not engage in gossip or triangulation.

---

**Example 4: You're having a hard day**

Healthy sharing:
> "I'm having a rough day today! Might be a bit slower to respond to things."

Oversharing that creates dependency:
> "I'm so depressed I can barely function. I don't know how I'll make it through the day. Can someone talk to me?"

You can be human and real without making students responsible for your wellbeing.

---

#### Teaching Friendship Skills Through Community

**Part of our work is helping people learn how to:**
- Make friends as neurodivergent adults
- Navigate conflict and repair
- Set boundaries without destroying relationships
- Ask for what they need
- Give support without burning out
- Build distributed support networks

**You teach this by modeling it:**
- Your friendships demonstrate healthy patterns
- Your boundaries show that "no" doesn't mean rejection
- Your repairs show that mistakes aren't relationship-ending
- Your distributed connections show that one person can't meet all needs

**This IS pedagogy. This IS liberatory education. We're not teaching abstract concepts—we're creating a container where people can practice being in relationship.**

---

#### The Special Case: When You Need to Remove a Friend

**This is the hardest scenario.**

If someone you genuinely care about is violating boundaries, harming the community, or can't function in this space right now, you might need to pause or end their participation.

**How to hold this:**

1. **Separate the person from the behavior**
   - "I care about you as a person AND this pattern doesn't work here"

2. **Be clear and direct**
   - "I need to pause your participation in Multiverse for now. Here's why: [specific pattern]. This isn't about you being bad—it's about fit."

3. **Maintain the friendship outside the community if possible**
   - "You're still my friend. AND you can't be in this space right now. Both are true."

4. **Don't let guilt override your judgment**
   - Removing a friend from the community is not betrayal
   - It might be the most loving thing you can do for everyone involved

5. **Grieve if you need to**
   - It's okay to be sad about this
   - You can care about someone and still enforce boundaries
   - This is hard. That's normal.

---

#### Red Flags: When "Friendship" Becomes Problematic

**Watch for:**

- You're making facilitation exceptions for a friend that you wouldn't for others
- You're avoiding enforcing boundaries because "they're my friend"
- Your friendship with one person is creating resentment in the community
- You're exhausted by the friendship but feel guilty setting limits
- The friend weaponizes the friendship ("I thought we were friends!")
- You're hiding the friendship or feeling weird about it

**If any of these are happening, you need to recalibrate.**

---

#### Remember: Friendship Is Healing

**For many neurodivergent people, Multiverse might be:**
- The first place they've felt truly understood
- The first time they've made real friends as an adult
- The first community where they don't have to mask
- The first place they've experienced conflict and repair

**Your friendships are part of that healing.**

When you show up as a whole person—someone who has boundaries AND warmth, who facilitates AND participates, who can be both teacher and friend—you model that these things aren't mutually exclusive.

**You started this school to make friends. That's beautiful. Keep doing it.**

Just do it with:
- Clear boundaries
- Distributed support
- Transparency about roles
- Care for the whole community
- Attention to your own wellbeing

**Friendship + boundaries = sustainable healing community.**

---

### 3. Time Boundaries

**Set clear availability:**
- Office hours or async response windows
- After-hours policy (e.g., "I don't respond to messages after 8pm")
- Response time expectations (e.g., "I reply within 48 hours")
- Emergency-only exceptions (and define what counts as emergency)

**Example policies:**

> **Office Hours:** Tuesdays 2-4pm, Thursdays 6-7pm
> **Email/DM Response Time:** Within 48 hours during weekdays
> **No Contact Hours:** After 9pm, before 9am, weekends
> **Emergency Protocol:** If you're in crisis, call 988. I will not respond to crisis messages; I'll refer you to appropriate help.

**Why neurodivergent students need this:**
- Many struggle with time blindness (ADHD)
- Autistic students may take "anytime" literally
- Explicit > Implicit

---

### 4. Emotional Boundaries

**You can:**
- Acknowledge someone's pain: "That sounds really hard"
- Express care: "I care about your wellbeing"
- Hold space briefly: "Take a moment if you need it"

**You cannot:**
- Absorb their emotions as your responsibility
- Fix their life circumstances
- Provide 24/7 emotional support
- Sacrifice your own wellbeing for theirs

**Script for when students overshare:**

> "I can see you're going through a lot. I care about your wellbeing, but I'm not the right person for this conversation. Have you talked to a therapist or called a support line? Here are some resources."

---

### 5. Scope of Work Boundaries

**You teach [your subject]. You are not:**
- A career coach (unless that's literally your job)
- A housing coordinator
- A financial advisor
- A life coach
- A social services agency
- A substitute parent

**Redirect skillfully:**

> "That's outside my area. Have you checked [appropriate resource]?"
> "I can help with [specific class topic]. For [other issue], you'll need [referral]."

---

## Common Boundary Challenges

### Challenge 1: "But I'm the Only One Who Understands Them"

**Why it happens:**
- Student has experienced rejection and misunderstanding
- You're neurodivergent-affirming and they feel safe
- They may have poor support networks

**Why it's a problem:**
- Creates unhealthy dependence
- Sets you up as savior (unsustainable)
- Prevents them from building broader support
- You will eventually disappoint them (you're human)

**How to respond:**

> "I'm glad you feel understood here. My role is to teach, not to be your primary support person. Let's talk about how you can build a support network outside of this class. Have you connected with [peer support groups, therapy, community resources]?"

---

### Challenge 2: Students in Crisis Want YOU Specifically

**Why it happens:**
- You've been kind and affirming
- They're in crisis and you're available
- Crisis lines feel impersonal

**Why it's a problem:**
- You're not trained for crisis intervention
- You can't be available 24/7
- It's not your role
- You could cause harm by being out of your depth

**How to respond:**

> "I hear that you trust me, and I appreciate that. I'm not trained to support you through this crisis. The people at 988 are. They do this every day and they're really good at it. Please call them. I'll be here for [class topic] when you're more grounded."

**Be firm.** Kindly, but firm.

---

### Challenge 3: "If You Cared, You'd [Unreasonable Ask]"

**Examples:**
- "If you cared, you'd answer my messages at night"
- "If this was a real community, you'd make exceptions for me"
- "Other teachers would do this for their students"

**Why it happens:**
- Manipulation (testing limits)
- Trauma (expecting rejection, so they test you)
- Genuine belief that care = unlimited availability

**Why it's a problem:**
- Manipulation tactic
- Sets impossible standards
- Leads to resentment and burnout

**How to respond:**

> "I do care about your wellbeing. That's exactly why I have boundaries—so I can show up sustainably for all students, including you. My boundary is [X]. That doesn't change."

**Do not justify endlessly.** State boundary once, hold it.

---

### Challenge 4: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) Spirals

**What happens:**
- You set a boundary
- Student perceives rejection and spirals
- "You hate me" / "I knew I wasn't good enough" / "I'll just leave"

**Why it happens:**
- RSD (common in ADHD, trauma)
- History of actual rejection and abandonment
- Emotional dysregulation

**How to respond:**

> "I can see you're really upset. This boundary isn't rejection. I care about you and I need to maintain [boundary] to stay sustainable. Take some time. When you're ready, we can talk about how to move forward."

**Don't:**
- Remove boundary to soothe them
- Over-explain or over-apologize
- Take responsibility for their emotional regulation

**Do:**
- Reaffirm care without removing boundary
- Give them space
- Hold firm

---

## Setting Boundaries with Neurodivergent-Affirming Language

### Be Explicit, Not Implied

**Instead of:** "I should probably get going..." (implied)
**Say:** "I need to end this conversation now." (explicit)

**Instead of:** "That's a lot..." (vague)
**Say:** "I can read up to 3 paragraphs. Can you summarize?" (specific)

### Separate Behavior from Person

**Instead of:** "You're being too much"
**Say:** "Sending 20 messages in an hour is more than I can respond to"

**Instead of:** "You're making me uncomfortable"
**Say:** "When you call me your 'soul teacher,' it makes our professional relationship uncomfortable for me"

### Offer Alternative When Possible

**Instead of:** "Stop messaging me at night"
**Say:** "I don't respond to messages after 8pm. Please use the forum during daytime hours, and I'll reply within 48 hours."

## Self-Assessment: Are Your Boundaries Healthy?

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Can I take a day off without guilt?
- [ ] Do I respond to student messages outside my stated hours?
- [ ] Have I ever felt resentful toward a student for needing too much?
- [ ] Do I feel responsible for students' emotional wellbeing?
- [ ] Have I ever skipped self-care to be available for a student?
- [ ] Do students know my personal phone number?
- [ ] Do I process student crises with friends/family because I'm carrying the weight?

**If you answered yes to more than 2:** Your boundaries need strengthening.

---

## How to Strengthen Boundaries

### 1. Get Clear on Your Limits
- What hours are you actually available?
- How much emotional labor can you sustainably offer?
- What topics are outside your scope?

### 2. Communicate Explicitly
- Post your availability in class materials
- Repeat boundaries when they're tested
- Don't assume students will "just know"

### 3. Redirect Skillfully
- Have crisis resources ready to copy/paste
- Know where to refer students for different needs
- Practice saying "That's outside my role"

### 4. Get Support
- Debrief with other teachers
- Don't carry student crises alone
- Escalate to admin when needed

### 5. Model Healthy Boundaries
- Students learn by watching you
- Show that rest, limits, and self-care are okay
- Normalize "No" as a complete sentence

---

## Teaching Students to Respect Boundaries

Many neurodivergent students haven't learned healthy boundaries. **You teach them by modeling and enforcing yours.**

**What students learn when you hold boundaries:**
- That care doesn't mean unlimited access
- That people can say no and still be kind
- That relationships can have structure and still be genuine
- That asking for too much doesn't mean they'll be abandoned (if you hold boundary with kindness)

**What students learn when you don't hold boundaries:**
- That they have to push to get needs met
- That boundaries are negotiable (they're not)
- That love/care means self-sacrifice
- That they can manipulate people by escalating emotion

---

## Boundary Scripts

### General Boundary Setting
> "I need to set a boundary. [Specific behavior] doesn't work for me. Here's what does: [alternative]."

### Redirecting to Resources
> "I care about your wellbeing, and that's why I want you to talk to someone equipped to help. Here are some resources: [list]."

### Ending Conversations
> "I need to wrap up this conversation. We can continue [when/where] if needed."

### Declining Requests
> "I can't do [request]. What I can do is [alternative or nothing]."

### Holding Boundary When Tested
> "We talked about this boundary on [date]. It still stands. If this continues, [consequence]."

## When to Seek Support or Make Difficult Decisions

Don't handle these situations without documentation and consultation:
- Student threatening self-harm or suicide
- Repeated boundary violations after you've set limits
- Stalking, harassment, or threats
- You feel unsafe
- You're emotionally exhausted by a student

**If you have co-facilitators:** Share the situation so you have backup and shared decision-making.

**If you're running solo:** Document thoroughly, consult with a peer educator or therapist (without sharing identifying details if needed), and trust your judgment about whether to continue working with this student. You have the authority to pause or end someone's participation if needed.

**It's not weak to seek consultation. It's wise.**

---

## Self-Care is Not Optional

**You cannot pour from an empty cup.** You teach better, hold boundaries better, and care better when you're resourced.

**Non-negotiables:**
- Sleep
- Time off
- Hobbies outside of teaching
- Relationships outside of students
- Therapy or peer support if you're carrying heavy stuff

**From peer support research:** Helpers need help too.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Boundaries are care** — For you and students
2. **Be explicit** — Neurodivergent people need clarity
3. **Hold firm kindly** — Don't waver, don't shame
4. **Model sustainability** — Show what healthy limits look like
5. **You're a teacher, not a savior** — Know your role

---

**Remember:** The best teachers know their limits and honor them. Your boundaries make you a better educator.
