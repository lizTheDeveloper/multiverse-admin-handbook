# Boundaries for Educators

## Why Boundaries Matter

Teaching neurodivergent adults is rewarding, intense, and potentially all-consuming. Without clear boundaries, you will:
- Burn out
- Become resentful
- Enable unhealthy dependence
- Model unsustainable behavior for students
- Compromise the learning environment

**From research:** The wellbeing of neurodivergent students improves with clear structure and consistent boundaries. Your boundaries help them thrive.

## Core Boundary Principles

### 1. You Are a Teacher, Not a Therapist

**What this means:**
- You can offer empathy, not therapy
- You can listen once, then redirect to appropriate resources
- You can teach, not heal trauma
- You can refer, not rescue

**Examples:**

**Okay:**
- "That sounds really hard. Have you talked to a therapist about this?"
- "I can see you're struggling. Here are some mental health resources."

**Not Okay:**
- Processing their childhood trauma in hour-long calls
- Becoming their emotional support person
- Adjusting your entire teaching style around their triggers

---

### 2. You Are a Teacher, Not a Friend

**What this means:**
- Professional warmth, not personal friendship
- You can care about students without being personally close
- Your role is temporary and structural, not lifelong and personal

**Examples:**

**Okay:**
- Answering teaching-related questions thoughtfully
- Celebrating student wins in class
- Being kind and personable in your interactions

**Not Okay:**
- Hanging out socially outside of class regularly
- Sharing your personal problems with students
- Letting students become your emotional support
- Creating "favorites" or inner circles

---

### 3. Time Boundaries

**Set clear availability:**
- Office hours or async response windows
- After-hours policy (e.g., "I don't respond to messages after 8pm")
- Response time expectations (e.g., "I reply within 48 hours")
- Emergency-only exceptions (and define what counts as emergency)

**Example policies:**

> **Office Hours:** Tuesdays 2-4pm, Thursdays 6-7pm
> **Email/DM Response Time:** Within 48 hours during weekdays
> **No Contact Hours:** After 9pm, before 9am, weekends
> **Emergency Protocol:** If you're in crisis, call 988. I will not respond to crisis messages; I'll refer you to appropriate help.

**Why neurodivergent students need this:**
- Many struggle with time blindness (ADHD)
- Autistic students may take "anytime" literally
- Explicit > Implicit

---

### 4. Emotional Boundaries

**You can:**
- Acknowledge someone's pain: "That sounds really hard"
- Express care: "I care about your wellbeing"
- Hold space briefly: "Take a moment if you need it"

**You cannot:**
- Absorb their emotions as your responsibility
- Fix their life circumstances
- Provide 24/7 emotional support
- Sacrifice your own wellbeing for theirs

**Script for when students overshare:**

> "I can see you're going through a lot. I care about your wellbeing, but I'm not the right person for this conversation. Have you talked to a therapist or called a support line? Here are some resources."

---

### 5. Scope of Work Boundaries

**You teach [your subject]. You are not:**
- A career coach (unless that's literally your job)
- A housing coordinator
- A financial advisor
- A life coach
- A social services agency
- A substitute parent

**Redirect skillfully:**

> "That's outside my area. Have you checked [appropriate resource]?"
> "I can help with [specific class topic]. For [other issue], you'll need [referral]."

---

## Common Boundary Challenges

### Challenge 1: "But I'm the Only One Who Understands Them"

**Why it happens:**
- Student has experienced rejection and misunderstanding
- You're neurodivergent-affirming and they feel safe
- They may have poor support networks

**Why it's a problem:**
- Creates unhealthy dependence
- Sets you up as savior (unsustainable)
- Prevents them from building broader support
- You will eventually disappoint them (you're human)

**How to respond:**

> "I'm glad you feel understood here. My role is to teach, not to be your primary support person. Let's talk about how you can build a support network outside of this class. Have you connected with [peer support groups, therapy, community resources]?"

---

### Challenge 2: Students in Crisis Want YOU Specifically

**Why it happens:**
- You've been kind and affirming
- They're in crisis and you're available
- Crisis lines feel impersonal

**Why it's a problem:**
- You're not trained for crisis intervention
- You can't be available 24/7
- It's not your role
- You could cause harm by being out of your depth

**How to respond:**

> "I hear that you trust me, and I appreciate that. I'm not trained to support you through this crisis. The people at 988 are. They do this every day and they're really good at it. Please call them. I'll be here for [class topic] when you're more grounded."

**Be firm.** Kindly, but firm.

---

### Challenge 3: "If You Cared, You'd [Unreasonable Ask]"

**Examples:**
- "If you cared, you'd answer my messages at night"
- "If this was a real community, you'd make exceptions for me"
- "Other teachers would do this for their students"

**Why it happens:**
- Manipulation (testing limits)
- Trauma (expecting rejection, so they test you)
- Genuine belief that care = unlimited availability

**Why it's a problem:**
- Manipulation tactic
- Sets impossible standards
- Leads to resentment and burnout

**How to respond:**

> "I do care about your wellbeing. That's exactly why I have boundaries—so I can show up sustainably for all students, including you. My boundary is [X]. That doesn't change."

**Do not justify endlessly.** State boundary once, hold it.

---

### Challenge 4: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) Spirals

**What happens:**
- You set a boundary
- Student perceives rejection and spirals
- "You hate me" / "I knew I wasn't good enough" / "I'll just leave"

**Why it happens:**
- RSD (common in ADHD, trauma)
- History of actual rejection and abandonment
- Emotional dysregulation

**How to respond:**

> "I can see you're really upset. This boundary isn't rejection. I care about you and I need to maintain [boundary] to stay sustainable. Take some time. When you're ready, we can talk about how to move forward."

**Don't:**
- Remove boundary to soothe them
- Over-explain or over-apologize
- Take responsibility for their emotional regulation

**Do:**
- Reaffirm care without removing boundary
- Give them space
- Hold firm

---

## Setting Boundaries with Neurodivergent-Affirming Language

### Be Explicit, Not Implied

**Instead of:** "I should probably get going..." (implied)
**Say:** "I need to end this conversation now." (explicit)

**Instead of:** "That's a lot..." (vague)
**Say:** "I can read up to 3 paragraphs. Can you summarize?" (specific)

### Separate Behavior from Person

**Instead of:** "You're being too much"
**Say:** "Sending 20 messages in an hour is more than I can respond to"

**Instead of:** "You're making me uncomfortable"
**Say:** "When you call me your 'soul teacher,' it makes our professional relationship uncomfortable for me"

### Offer Alternative When Possible

**Instead of:** "Stop messaging me at night"
**Say:** "I don't respond to messages after 8pm. Please use the forum during daytime hours, and I'll reply within 48 hours."

## Self-Assessment: Are Your Boundaries Healthy?

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Can I take a day off without guilt?
- [ ] Do I respond to student messages outside my stated hours?
- [ ] Have I ever felt resentful toward a student for needing too much?
- [ ] Do I feel responsible for students' emotional wellbeing?
- [ ] Have I ever skipped self-care to be available for a student?
- [ ] Do students know my personal phone number?
- [ ] Do I process student crises with friends/family because I'm carrying the weight?

**If you answered yes to more than 2:** Your boundaries need strengthening.

---

## How to Strengthen Boundaries

### 1. Get Clear on Your Limits
- What hours are you actually available?
- How much emotional labor can you sustainably offer?
- What topics are outside your scope?

### 2. Communicate Explicitly
- Post your availability in class materials
- Repeat boundaries when they're tested
- Don't assume students will "just know"

### 3. Redirect Skillfully
- Have crisis resources ready to copy/paste
- Know where to refer students for different needs
- Practice saying "That's outside my role"

### 4. Get Support
- Debrief with other teachers
- Don't carry student crises alone
- Escalate to admin when needed

### 5. Model Healthy Boundaries
- Students learn by watching you
- Show that rest, limits, and self-care are okay
- Normalize "No" as a complete sentence

---

## Teaching Students to Respect Boundaries

Many neurodivergent students haven't learned healthy boundaries. **You teach them by modeling and enforcing yours.**

**What students learn when you hold boundaries:**
- That care doesn't mean unlimited access
- That people can say no and still be kind
- That relationships can have structure and still be genuine
- That asking for too much doesn't mean they'll be abandoned (if you hold boundary with kindness)

**What students learn when you don't hold boundaries:**
- That they have to push to get needs met
- That boundaries are negotiable (they're not)
- That love/care means self-sacrifice
- That they can manipulate people by escalating emotion

---

## Boundary Scripts

### General Boundary Setting
> "I need to set a boundary. [Specific behavior] doesn't work for me. Here's what does: [alternative]."

### Redirecting to Resources
> "I care about your wellbeing, and that's why I want you to talk to someone equipped to help. Here are some resources: [list]."

### Ending Conversations
> "I need to wrap up this conversation. We can continue [when/where] if needed."

### Declining Requests
> "I can't do [request]. What I can do is [alternative or nothing]."

### Holding Boundary When Tested
> "We talked about this boundary on [date]. It still stands. If this continues, [consequence]."

---

## When to Escalate to Admin

Don't handle these alone:
- Student threatening self-harm or suicide
- Repeated boundary violations after you've set limits
- Stalking, harassment, or threats
- You feel unsafe
- You're emotionally exhausted by a student

**It's not weak to escalate. It's professional.**

---

## Self-Care is Not Optional

**You cannot pour from an empty cup.** You teach better, hold boundaries better, and care better when you're resourced.

**Non-negotiables:**
- Sleep
- Time off
- Hobbies outside of teaching
- Relationships outside of students
- Therapy or peer support if you're carrying heavy stuff

**From peer support research:** Helpers need help too.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Boundaries are care** — For you and students
2. **Be explicit** — Neurodivergent people need clarity
3. **Hold firm kindly** — Don't waver, don't shame
4. **Model sustainability** — Show what healthy limits look like
5. **You're a teacher, not a savior** — Know your role

---

**Remember:** The best teachers know their limits and honor them. Your boundaries make you a better educator.
