# Ethical Considerations for Teaching Neurodivergent Adults

## Purpose

This guide addresses the unique ethical considerations that arise when teaching neurodivergent adults, particularly those with trauma histories, mental health conditions, and complex support needs.

**Core question:** How do we balance individual needs with community safety while maintaining ethical standards?

**From disability justice principles:** "Nothing About Us Without Us" — Ethical practice centers disabled and neurodivergent voices, not clinical or allistic frameworks imposed from outside.

---

## Foundational Ethical Framework

### The Three-Part Test

When facing an ethical dilemma, ask:

1. **Does this respect the student's autonomy and dignity?**
   - Are we infantilizing them or treating them as adults?
   - Are we making decisions for them or with them?

2. **Does this keep the community safe?**
   - Are we prioritizing one person's needs over everyone's safety?
   - Are we enabling harm by avoiding necessary boundaries?

3. **Is this consistent with our stated values?**
   - Would we do this for any student, or just this one?
   - Are we operating transparently?

**All three must be yes.** If you can only answer yes to two, you have an ethical problem.

## Power Dynamics in Adult Education

### The Teacher-Student Relationship

**From transformative justice research:** Even in adult education, teachers hold structural power:
- Control over access (can remove students)
- Social power (community respects teacher authority)
- Information asymmetry (know things students don't)
- Economic power (in paid programs)

**Why this matters:**
- Students may struggle to say no to teachers
- Trauma survivors may fawn (people-please) even when uncomfortable
- Neurodivergent students may not recognize coercion
- Power imbalance makes true consent complicated

---

### Ethical Use of Teacher Power

**Appropriate uses:**
- Setting boundaries for sustainability
- Enforcing Code of Conduct
- Removing students who harm others
- Referring to appropriate resources
- Teaching and facilitating

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Personal relationships with students (romantic, business partnerships while enrolled)
- Using student vulnerability for emotional fulfillment
- Making students dependent on you
- Sharing student information without consent
- Using your authority to silence criticism

---

## Informed Consent in Educational Contexts

### What Students Should Know Before Joining

**Ethically, students must understand:**
- What participation requires (time, emotional energy, disclosure expectations)
- What happens if they can't meet expectations
- Who has access to their information
- How conflicts are handled
- What the removal process looks like
- What support is and isn't available

**From AASPIRE research on autistic consent:** Autistic adults need explicit, concrete information to provide informed consent — vague or implied expectations don't work.

**Best practice:** Provide written documentation of all expectations before enrollment.

---

### Consent for Disclosure

**Students with mental health conditions or trauma may disclose a lot.**

**Ethical questions:**
1. **Did they understand what they were sharing?**
   - Were they in crisis (impaired consent)?
   - Did they know this would be documented?
   - Did they understand who would have access?

2. **What are your obligations once you know?**
   - Do you need to refer to crisis support (if threat to self/others)?
   - Do you need to document for safety reasons?
   - Should you inform other staff for support coordination?

**Best practice template:**
> "Thank you for sharing that with me. I want to make sure you know: I document concerning patterns for safety reasons, and I share information with co-facilitators when necessary to support you or protect the community. Is there anything you shared that you'd prefer I not document?"

This gives them a chance to reconsider while being transparent about your role.

---

## Balancing Individual Needs vs. Community Safety

### The Hardest Ethical Question

**Scenario:** A student is struggling significantly. They need support. Providing that support would drain resources from other students or compromise community safety.

**What do you do?**

---

### Framework: Levels of Need

**From disability justice and harm reduction:**

**Level 1: Accommodation (always provide)**
- Extended deadlines for neurodivergent processing
- Captions, transcripts, alternative formats
- Flexible attendance for disability/health
- Communication style differences
- Reasonable adjustments to participation

**Level 2: Support (provide when possible)**
- Extra check-ins during difficult periods
- Reduced expectations during crisis
- Referrals to appropriate resources
- Emotional support within teacher role

**Level 3: Rescue (not your role)**
- Being available 24/7 for crises
- Solving housing/financial/health emergencies
- Providing therapy or clinical support
- Taking responsibility for their survival

**Ethical principle:** You can provide Level 1 and 2. Level 3 is outside your role and creates harm.

---

### When Individual Needs Conflict with Community Safety

**Examples:**
- Student in crisis is disrupting class for everyone
- Student's behavior is triggering other students
- One student needs disproportionate teacher time
- Student's actions violate others' boundaries

**Ethical decision framework:**

1. **Can the need be met without compromising community?**
   - YES → Accommodate
   - NO → Move to step 2

2. **Can we create temporary accommodations?**
   - Reduced participation, pause, alternative format?
   - YES → Offer options
   - NO → Move to step 3

3. **Is the community safe with this person present?**
   - YES → Continue with boundaries
   - NO → Removal necessary

**Guiding principle:** You can care about someone's wellbeing AND remove them from community. Both are true.

---

## Transparency vs. Privacy

### What Information Can You Share?

**From FERPA and adult education ethics:**

**Always private:**
- Mental health diagnoses or disclosures
- Trauma history
- Medical information
- Financial struggles
- Personal crises (housing, relationships, etc.)

**Sometimes public (with consent or necessity):**
- That someone is no longer in the program (without reasons)
- General patterns that affect others ("Someone tested positive for COVID" without names)
- De-identified examples for teaching purposes

**Must be public:**
- Code of Conduct violations that pose ongoing risk
- Disaffiliation from someone claiming association
- Safety warnings if someone is recruiting/harming

---

### Template: Deciding What to Disclose

Ask yourself:

1. **Whose safety does this information protect?**
   - Just gossip → Don't share
   - Protects community → Consider sharing

2. **Can I share without identifying details?**
   - YES → Share general pattern
   - NO → Only share if safety requires it

3. **Am I sharing to warn or to punish?**
   - To warn → Ethical
   - To punish/shame → Not ethical

4. **What's the minimum necessary information?**
   - Share only what people need to stay safe
   - Don't provide unnecessary details

---

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1:** Student removed for crisis dependency
- ❌ Don't say: "Morgan was removed because they kept having mental health crises"
- ✅ Do say: "Morgan is no longer participating. We can't share details."

**Scenario 2:** Student removed for harassment
- ❌ Don't say: "Jordan was sexually harassing people"
- ✅ Do say: "Jordan violated our Code of Conduct and is no longer affiliated with us"

**Scenario 3:** Student removed and claiming affiliation after removal
- ❌ Don't say: Nothing (letting them claim affiliation harms others)
- ✅ Do say: "Alex is not affiliated with The Multiverse School. We do not endorse their projects. Please exercise caution."

---

## Avoiding Ableism While Maintaining Safety

### The Core Tension

**Ableism says:** "Remove all neurodivergent/mentally ill people because they're difficult"

**Appropriate boundaries say:** "Remove people whose behavior harms others, regardless of why"

**How to tell the difference:**

---

### Ableist Response vs. Ethical Boundary

**Scenario:** Autistic student is blunt and direct in a way that feels rude

**Ableist response:**
- "You need to be nicer or you'll be removed"
- Tone policing
- Requiring neurotypical communication style

**Ethical response:**
- "Direct communication is fine here. If someone says you've hurt them, can you engage with that feedback?"
- Distinguishing communication style from impact
- Focusing on willingness to repair, not style

---

**Scenario:** ADHD student misses deadlines frequently

**Ableist response:**
- "If you can't keep up, you shouldn't be here"
- No flexibility
- Same expectations for everyone regardless of disability

**Ethical response:**
- "Let's talk about what's realistic for you. Do you need extensions, reduced workload, or a pause?"
- Accommodation while maintaining standards
- Flexibility within structure

---

**Scenario:** Student with BPD splitting on teacher (seeing them as all-bad)

**Ableist response:**
- "You're too difficult to work with"
- Removal without attempting boundaries
- Labeling them as "borderline" pejoratively

**Ethical response:**
- "I hear you're upset. Here's what I can and can't do. I need you to speak to me respectfully even when you're angry."
- Clear boundaries
- Addressing behavior, not diagnosis

---

### Key Distinction

**Accommodation:** Adjusting format, timeline, or expectations to account for disability
**Enabling:** Removing all consequences for harmful behavior because of disability

**Both ableism and enabling are unethical.**

**From disability justice:** Disabled people deserve accountability, not infantilization.

---

## Ethical Considerations Around Mental Health

### You Are Not a Therapist

**This is an ethical boundary, not a personal choice.**

**Why it matters:**
- You lack training to provide therapy
- Dual relationships (teacher + therapist) are harmful
- Creates dependency
- Opens you to liability
- Takes you away from your actual role

**What this means in practice:**

❌ **Don't:**
- Provide therapy or therapeutic interventions
- Diagnose mental health conditions
- Adjust medications or treatment plans
- Be their primary support during crisis
- Position yourself as their healer

✅ **Do:**
- Acknowledge they're struggling
- Refer to appropriate resources
- Offer accommodations within your role
- Set boundaries about what you can/can't provide
- Document concerning patterns

---

### Reporting Requirements for Online Adult Education

**Important: You're probably NOT a mandatory reporter.**

**As an online adult education program working with adult students:**
- You likely have **no legal obligation** to report suicidal ideation or threats
- Mandatory reporting typically applies to K-12 teachers, licensed professionals, and those working with minors or vulnerable adults
- The Multiverse School teaches autonomous adults

**This means:**
- You don't have to call police or authorities (unless true emergency)
- You don't have to break confidentiality to report to anyone
- You're not legally liable for a student's autonomous choices

**However, you still have ethical obligations:**
- Take suicidal ideation seriously
- Refer to crisis resources (988)
- Document what was disclosed
- Inform co-facilitators if you have them
- Assess whether you believe person is in immediate danger

**Ethical template for transparency:**
> "I want you to feel comfortable talking to me. I also need you to know: if you tell me you're planning to harm yourself or others, I'm going to connect you to crisis support resources like 988. That's to help you, not to punish you. I'll also inform co-facilitators so we can support you as a team."

**This is more accurate than claiming you're "required to report" when you're likely not.**

**Check your specific state:** Some states have broader mandatory reporter definitions. Consult legal counsel if unsure.

---

### Working with Students Who Refuse Help

**Scenario:** Student is clearly struggling (psychosis, severe depression, mania) and refuses to get help.

**Your ethical obligations:**
1. Inform them of resources
2. Set boundaries about what you can provide
3. Assess safety to community
4. Document
5. Remove if necessary

**You cannot force them to get help.** You can only control your boundaries and their access to your community.

**From peer support research (NEST 2024):** "Forced treatment often backfires. What works: consistent boundaries, genuine care, and letting people make their own choices."

---

## Ethical Frameworks for Neurodivergent-Led Spaces

### Disability Justice Principles

**From Sins Invalid and disability justice movement:**

1. **Leadership of those most impacted**
   - Neurodivergent people lead, not "experts about us"
   - Center lived experience

2. **Anti-capitalist politic**
   - Reject productivity as measure of worth
   - Accommodate different paces and capacities

3. **Cross-movement solidarity**
   - Disability intersects with race, class, gender, sexuality
   - Don't separate oppressions

4. **Recognizing wholeness**
   - People aren't broken and don't need fixing
   - Accommodation, not cure

5. **Sustainability**
   - Don't burn out leaders
   - Collective care, not martyrdom

6. **Commitment to cross-disability solidarity**
   - Physical disability, neurodivergence, mental health, chronic illness—all disability
   - Don't create hierarchies

7. **Interdependence**
   - We need each other
   - Mutual aid, not independence as goal

8. **Collective access**
   - Access isn't individual accommodations
   - Build accessible structures from start

9. **Collective liberation**
   - No one is free until we're all free
   - Transformative justice, not punitive

10. **Nothing About Us Without Us**
    - Don't make decisions about disabled people without disabled people

**How this applies to The Multiverse School:**
- Neurodivergent-led means neurodivergent people in leadership
- Flexibility and accommodation are default, not special treatment
- Removal uses transformative justice principles, not punishment
- Community accountability over calling authorities when possible
- Recognition that many students are multiply marginalized

---

### Transformative Justice in Educational Settings

**From Autistic Women & Nonbinary Network (AWN):**

**Traditional punitive justice:**
- Someone does harm → Punish them
- Focus on rule-breaking
- Authority makes decisions
- Goal: Deterrence

**Transformative justice:**
- Someone does harm → Understand context, repair harm, prevent recurrence
- Focus on safety and accountability
- Community involved in decisions
- Goal: Transformation and healing

**In practice at Multiverse:**

**When harm occurs:**
1. **Pause and assess:** What happened? Who was harmed?
2. **Accountability:** Can the person who caused harm take responsibility?
3. **Repair:** What would help the harmed person feel safe?
4. **Prevention:** What structures would prevent this recurring?
5. **Consequence:** May include removal, but framed as safety measure, not punishment

**Example:**
- Student makes ableist comment in class
- Traditional: "You're removed for violating Code of Conduct"
- Transformative: "That comment caused harm. Here's why. Can you understand the impact and commit to not repeating it? Here's what repair might look like."

**When removal is still necessary:**
- Framed as: "You cannot participate safely right now"
- Not: "You're bad and being punished"
- Opens possibility of return when safety is established

---

## Ethical Considerations Around Specific Populations

### Students with Trauma Histories

**Ethical obligations:**
- Don't require trauma disclosure for participation
- Don't use trauma against them ("You're just triggered")
- Recognize trauma responses without enabling harmful behavior
- Provide care without becoming their therapist

**From trauma-informed education research:**
> "Trauma-informed teaching creates safety, transparency, peer support, collaboration, and empowerment. It does NOT mean accepting all behavior without boundaries."

---

### Students with Psychosis or Delusions

**Ethical considerations:**
- Don't mock or shame their beliefs
- Don't pretend to agree with delusions
- Maintain reality while respecting dignity
- Refer to appropriate care
- Assess safety, not "weirdness"

**What's ethical:**
> "I hear that's your experience. I don't share that perception, and I'm concerned about your safety."

**What's not ethical:**
> "You're crazy" or "That's ridiculous"

---

### Students Who Are Suicidal

**Ethical obligations:**
1. Take it seriously
2. Refer to crisis support (988)
3. Assess imminent risk
4. Document
5. Don't promise confidentiality you can't keep
6. Don't become their reason to live

**From 988 Lifeline research:**
> "The most helpful response to suicidal ideation is calm, direct engagement, connection to trained support, and removal of means if accessible."

**You can care AND maintain boundaries:**
> "I'm taking this seriously. Please call 988 right now. You matter, and you need professional crisis support."

---

### Students in Marginalized Identities

**Ethical considerations when students are:**
- BIPOC in predominantly white spaces
- Trans/nonbinary in cisnormative spaces
- Poor/working-class in middle-class-normed spaces
- Multiply disabled

**From intersectionality research:**
- Marginalized students face additional barriers
- May be hypervigilant about discrimination (because it's real)
- May test whether space is actually safe
- May have less margin for error (housing, financial, health insecurity)

**Ethical obligations:**
- Accommodate impacts of systemic oppression
- Don't require "perfect" behavior from marginalized students while tolerating microaggressions from privileged students
- Recognize when "behavior problems" are trauma responses to oppression
- AND still maintain boundaries when harm occurs

**This is hard. Both things are true:**
- Systemic oppression creates barriers and trauma
- People are still accountable for harm they cause

---

## Conflicts of Interest

### When You Shouldn't Teach a Student

**Ethical red flags:**
- You have a prior personal relationship
- You're attracted to them
- They remind you intensely of someone (trauma trigger, lost loved one, etc.)
- You have financial entanglement
- You're in recovery together (AA, etc.)

**What to do:** Refer them to another teacher. Explain honestly: "I have a conflict of interest that would prevent me from being objective."

---

### When Students Want to Become Collaborators

**Scenario:** Student wants to work with you on a project, join your organization, become your business partner.

**Ethical considerations:**
1. **Power imbalance:** Can they truly say no while enrolled?
2. **Dual relationship:** Teacher + boss/partner = complicated
3. **Other students' perception:** Does this create favoritism?

**Best practice:**
- Wait until they've completed the program
- Minimum 6-month gap between student role and collaboration
- Clear documentation of the transition
- Transparency with other students

---

## Self-Care as Ethical Obligation

### Why Your Wellbeing Matters Ethically

**From teacher burnout research:**
Burned-out teachers:
- Make worse decisions
- Have less patience
- Are more likely to violate boundaries
- Can't provide consistent care
- Model unsustainable patterns

**Therefore: Taking care of yourself is an ethical responsibility, not selfishness.**

---

### Ethical Self-Care Practices

1. **Maintain boundaries** (availability, scope of support)
2. **Seek supervision** (process with difficult situations)
3. **Take time off** (model sustainability)
4. **Don't martyr yourself** (doesn't help anyone)
5. **Recognize your limits** (refer when needed)

**From disability justice:** "Sustainability is a core principle. We can't burn out leaders and call it justice."

---

## Ethical Decision-Making Framework

### When You're Not Sure What to Do

**Step 1: Identify the ethical tension**
- What values are in conflict?
- Who is affected?
- What are the stakes?

**Step 2: Consult**
- Co-facilitators or peer advisors
- Colleagues
- Relevant research/guidelines
- Don't decide in isolation

**Step 3: Apply the Three-Part Test**
1. Does this respect autonomy and dignity?
2. Does this keep community safe?
3. Is this consistent with stated values?

**Step 4: Document your reasoning**
- Why you made this choice
- What alternatives you considered
- Who you consulted

**Step 5: Be transparent** (when appropriate)
- Explain your reasoning to affected parties
- Invite feedback
- Adjust if needed

---

## Common Ethical Dilemmas & How to Navigate Them

### Dilemma 1: Student Discloses Trauma in Class

**Tension:** You want to honor their vulnerability, but it's not appropriate for the setting and may trigger others.

**Ethical response:**
> "Thank you for trusting us with that. I want to make sure you get appropriate support. Can we talk after class about resources? For now, let's refocus on [class topic]."

**Why:** Respects their disclosure, redirects to appropriate venue, protects other students.

---

### Dilemma 2: Student Accuses You of Discrimination

**Tension:** You believe your actions were appropriate, but they feel harmed.

**Ethical response:**
> "I take that seriously. Tell me more about what happened from your perspective. I want to understand your experience, even if my intent was different."

**Then:**
- Listen fully
- Acknowledge impact (even if you disagree with interpretation)
- Consult with co-facilitators or advisors
- Assess: Is there validity? Was I biased? Or is this a misunderstanding?
- Respond transparently

**Why:** Takes complaint seriously, models accountability, gets support before responding defensively.

---

### Dilemma 3: You Know Student Is Lying

**Tension:** They're claiming something factually untrue (about why they missed class, what you said, etc.). Calling them a liar feels harsh, but letting it go feels like enabling.

**Ethical response:**
> "That's not consistent with what I remember/have documented. Here's what I have: [facts]. Can you help me understand the discrepancy?"

**If they double down:**
> "I hear that's your perception. Here's what I'm working from: [documented facts]. We don't have to agree on interpretation, but these are the facts as I have them."

**Why:** Maintains reality without shaming, documents clearly, doesn't enable false narratives.

---

### Dilemma 4: Student Needs More Than You Can Provide

**Tension:** They genuinely need support. You can't provide it without burning out or neglecting others.

**Ethical response:**
> "I can see you're dealing with a lot. What you need is beyond what I can provide as a teacher. Here are resources that can actually help: [therapy, crisis line, peer support, etc.]. Within my role, here's what I can offer: [specific, limited support]."

**Why:** Acknowledges need, refers appropriately, maintains boundaries.

---

### Dilemma 5: One Student Takes Up All Your Energy

**Tension:** Other students are noticing you spend disproportionate time on one person. That person genuinely needs support.

**Ethical response:**
Assess:
- Is the support I'm providing appropriate to my role? (If no → refer out)
- Am I making exceptions for this student I wouldn't for others? (If yes → stop)
- Is this sustainable? (If no → change approach)

**Then:**
> "I notice I've been spending a lot of time supporting you one-on-one. I need to rebalance so all students get equitable access. Here's what I can offer going forward: [reduced support]. For additional support, here are resources: [referrals]."

**Why:** Equity matters, models boundaries, prevents burnout.

---

## When You Make Mistakes

### Ethical Response to Your Own Errors

**You will make mistakes.** You're human. What matters is how you respond.

**When you realize you messed up:**

1. **Acknowledge it** (to yourself and affected parties)
   > "I made a mistake. I should have [done X instead of Y]."

2. **Take responsibility** (no deflecting)
   > "That's on me, not you."

3. **Repair** (what would help?)
   > "Here's what I'm going to do to fix this: [specific actions]."

4. **Change** (prevent recurrence)
   > "Here's what I'm doing to make sure this doesn't happen again: [new practice]."

5. **Model accountability**
   > Students learn from watching you take responsibility

**What's not ethical:**
- Defending yourself endlessly
- Blaming the student
- Pretending it didn't happen
- Making it about your feelings ("I feel so bad")
